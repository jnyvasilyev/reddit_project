* [Take Jury Duty! Understand Jury Nullification. Stanhope Explains.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1k4fYIUuAP8)

* It is 100% legal to openly record police in all 50 states as long as you do not physically interfere with the officer. (It's also probably wise to speak as little as possible, but DO make note of details - location, names, etc) 

* Police officers do not have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" while preforming their public duties.

* If an officer says it's illegal to record him, that officer is lying to try and trick you into shutting off the camera so you won't have proof of them violating your rights.

* Use a livestreaming app to record your videos. If your phone is seized, the police cannot delete the video because the video was never on the phone to begin with.

2,BlackLivesMatter,Black Lives Matter,News and links related to Black Lives Matter. Must be woke to participate.,"[](/sidebar)


**BlackLivesMatter**
-

A subreddit for Black Lives Matter movement related posts and comments. 


**Rules:**
-

- **Follow Reddit Rules:** No inciting violence, posting personally-identifiable information/doxxing, or posting misinformation. We know information is moving fast, but do your best to find sources.
- **No hateful content or harmful behaviors:** No racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, etc is welcome here. We center black voices and will not allow others to speak over us. Trolling or joke comments are not welcome because this is serious, we are fighting for our lives.
- **Cite your Sources:** Informational posts are welcome, but if it is an uncited claim or just a screenshot, you'll be asked to repost it with a more reliable source such as a news article. We want to minimize any chance of misinformation.
- **We aren't here to educate you:** If you are just now realizing that police brutality against black people is a problem or haven't even reached this step yet, please leave. We do not have the time, energy, or emotional fortitude to deal with you. People that want to teach and want to learn go to /r/socialjustice101. For discussions on race in general, see /r/racism. 
- **Gaslighting:** Any post and comment directing blame to the protestor or any pearl clutching about ""looting"" will result in an immediate ban. ""Both sides"" rhetoric or black on black crime misdirection will also result in being banned. Trying to use Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to silence black people applies as well.
- **Reposts:** Always Check to see if a post has already been made first. 
- **Message the Moderators:** If you have an inquiry, do not contact individual moderators by PM or through their direct chat. Always use the ""Message the Moderators"" button on the subreddit.
- **Spam/Self Promotion that does not enrich black people:** Merchandise and youtube posts are not welcome here unless the content creators are black people. This includes posts offering a service or good in exchange for donating the proceeds to black organizations. Please understand that even if you have the best of intentions, it doesn't mean that others aren't trying to either promote themselves or try to sell something in the name of offering to BLM but not actually following through on that. 
- **Goals:** Posts asking what Black Lives Matter's goals are or what they plan to accomplish will be deleted. [Check BlackLivesMatter's website.] (https://blacklivesmatter.com/) 
- **What can I do?:** Posts asking ""What Can I Do"" will be removed. As a starting point, [read this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLivesMatter/comments/gv6cxh/what_can_i_do_to_help_a_general_list_of_dos_and/)  and know that there is a great deal of emotional labor in asking black people to explain what you should be doing. There are already plenty of resources to educate yourself (several of which are mentioned in the link) so educate yourself first before asking other people to educate you.
- **Covid 19:** Posts downplaying the severity of Covid-19 or suggesting people ignore it will be deleted.  **If you or someone you live with is immunocompromised, do not put yourself or them at risk.** The protests are for a just cause, but they are not the only form of activism possible. 
- **Black on Black Crime:** This talking point is a non-issue and a common deflection attempt rooted in misinformation. [This article] (https://www.theroot.com/why-we-never-talk-about-black-on-black-crime-an-answer-1819092337) deconstructs it pretty well, but we're not wasting time or space explaining why it's nonsense.
- **Moderator Discretion:** This is an unspoken rule on reddit, but mods may remove/ban anything and anyone at any time for any reason. Things may need to be removed that do not fit cleanly into the above rules. Attempts to be a rule lawyer with us will result in perm ban and mute.

We focus on SOLUTIONS, not problems. Please do not post a bunch of 'look what society is doing to us again' posts unless you are posting a solution to the issue.

**Do not insult, demean, or in other ways abuse anyone here.** You are welcome to debate. Conflicting opinions are fine. Handle them like adults with discussion. Abusive posts, comments, or obvious trolling attempts will be removed and you will be firmly escorted to the door.

**FAQ:**

**Q: I'm feeling really discriminated against by the existence of a Black power sub when there isn't a white power sub! That's not fair! I want to say I'm proud to be white but if I did you'd say I was racist! This sub is reverse racism!""**

A: If you are not aware of the inherent differences in the concept and expression of Black power as opposed to the concept and expression of white power, we suggest you go Google the terms and then take your energy off somewhere else to have a nice day. Nobody cares if you love being white, are proud to be white, would rather be white than anything. Good for you! Now go forth and enjoy yourself. We are not sitting around here thinking about you. If that hurts your feelings, welp.

**Q: I want to tell you all about what I think is wrong with Black/white/other people and why they're the cause of all problems in my personal life. Can I do that here?**

A: Nope.

**Q: I'm looking for more resources on the history and current state of Black empowerment, where do I start?**

A: If you would like a book list, we can probably compile one, just ask. If you want some internet links, try some of the ones listed below.

2. All links to other subreddits must be np or redditlog.

3. Sensitive information in pictures must be blocked out.

4. Absolutely no blatant racism, sexism, or other types of bigotry (Yes, this includes bigotry against people who aren't considered minorities.) Discussion on these topics is allowed but try to keep it civil.

6. It does not matter if they are what they say they are. Please stop asking.

7. All posts must include a submission statement, clearly explaining why the post is appropriate for this sub. This is to ensure that there is not misunderstanding the overall stance of the sub, i.e. anti-racism, anti-bigotry.

**[What is BPT Country Club and how do I get verified?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/158a9t9/what_is_bpt_country_club_and_how_do_i_get/?)**

---
☑️
RULES

1.) **Do not post content just because a black person posted it.** This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people.

-    1. **No original content.** We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just  for     this subreddit.
  


2.) No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).
 
3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
 
4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.
 
5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).

6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.

7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.

8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add ""bruh"", ""fam"", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.

9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking ""what does x mean?"" will be removed. 


10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.
 
11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  

12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**

 * Do not post GIFs that have already appeared on /r/GIFs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post GIFs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to GIF formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  †**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/wiki/rule9)

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**† We may allow multiple cuts and/or GIFs up to a minute long depending on the popularity of a post. Sound, text boxes, and GIFs that heavily depend on captions are still not allowed.**

&nbsp;

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/GIFs.

# Rules


#**No hateful comments about any animals. No hateful comments about people. No suggestions of violence toward animals.  No breed  hate. No animal cruelty. We will ban you for content such as this.**

- If you see any posts that violate any of the rules, please report the post and message the mods a link to it

1. Please only post animals being jerks, not humans being jerks.

2. We're here to have a laugh, please keep posts funny. That means **no posts of animals being killed or  injured, no suggestions of violence toward any animals or people and no bigotry toward any living being.**

3. Do not post content that is already in the [top 100 posts of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingJerks/top/) You can check for reposts by copying the link and pasting [here]( http://karmadecay.com/r/animalsbeingjerks?url=ref). Recent reposts will also be removed. Reposts within 3 months of each other will be removed. Reposts may also result in a ban. Permanent bans are issued  for repost farming.  If you submit a post that has already been reposted more than 3 times, your post will be removed.  

4. If your post is NSFW, please label it as such.

5. Refrain from promoting hate speech, racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, and any other abusive/threatening language. ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature.

6. No memes or comics.  No compilation videos and collection of pictures/gifs.  

7. Posts must depict animals actually being jerks. Please do not post animals engaging in normal animal behavior which might simply inconvenience humans, and do not make posts which require you to add context for the jerky behavior to be understood. Moderators will remove such posts at their discretion.  

8. All submissions must show an animal actively being a jerk. Animals posing next to shredded pillows etc are not allowed. The jerkiness must be evident from the material posted.

**/r/Texas Rules:**

1\. **Be Friendly:** Personal attacks on your fellow Reddit users are not allowed, this includes both direct insults and general aggressiveness.  In addition, hate speech, threats (regardless of intent), and calls to violence, will also be removed. Remember the human and follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

Criticism and jokes at the expense of politicians, pundits, and other public figures have been and always will be allowed, and do not constitute a violation of the rule.

2\. **Use Your Words:** Posts and Comments consisting of one word or just an emoji are highly discouraged as we seek to foster debate and conversation.  As such they are subject to removal.  

3\. **This is /r/texas:** Links and posts must be directly about Texas, not regional/national/worldwide things that happen to involve Texas.  

4\. **No Personal Information:** Doxxing and posting personal information, such as names, phone numbers, links to social networking sites, is strictly prohibited. Some social network info will be exempted on a case by case basis.  

5\. **No Spam:** If most of your posts and comments are to your own projects, then you're taking advantage of our community and spamming. Please make sure you submit other things and participate on other people's posts. If you think your post might be considered spam, message the mods for approval first.  There are no petitions allowed on the sub either.

6\. **No Reposting:** Reposts will be removed, please search before you post. If you want to post another view of the same story, we ask that you contribute it to the comments of the original post. If there is a megathread about a popular story, please add your submission there. Should the original post be removed by a mod then a subsequent repost is not considered a violation of this rule. 
 
7\. **Political Discourse:** Politics are fine but state your case, explain why you hold the positions that you do and debate with civility.  Posts and comments meant solely to troll or enrage people, and those that are little more than campaign ads or slogans do nothing to contribute to a healthy debate and will therefore be removed.  Petitions will also be removed.  AMA's by Political figures are exempt from this rule. 

8\. **No Excessive Caps:** No caps lock in titles other than acronyms or initials. Comments and titles with a large percentage of all caps, are considered 'shouting' as well as annoying and will be removed.  

9\. **News Articles:** News articles are fine, but must be no older than one month. Your post title must match the article title. You are free to editorialize in a separate comment. Articles posted from biased or secondary sources will be reviewed and accepted/removed upon moderator discretion. Sites with hard leaning bias will be removed immediately. Additionally please use actual articles and not Tweets. Examples of trusted sources: Reuters, AP, NPR, NBC, ABC, CBS, BBC.  
  
10\. **No Confrontational User Pings:** Use username pings (e.g. /u/username in a comment) sparingly and in a non-confrontational manner. If you're considering pinging someone to get their attention on something that they might be interested in, that's fine. If you're considering pinging someone to prove a point or continue debate, that's not ok. Excessive username pings can be considered to be harassment and may be reported to the Reddit admins.  

11\. **No Disparagement of an Individual's Disabilities:** While you're free to argue against, debate, criticize, etc. the policies, ideas, politics, and character of any politician, please do not make jokes about anyone's disability.  All such ""jokes"" will be removed.

Links and comments that violate the rules will be removed. Repeat or severe offenders will be banned.  This is an actively moderated subreddit. Calls will be made at the moderator's discretion.

27,syriancivilwar,Syria's Civil War (2011—ongoing),"This subreddit is dedicated to news, analysis and discussion on the conflicts in Syria and Iraq along with the regional and global ramifications.","# About us





This subreddit is dedicated to the current conflicts ongoing in Syria and Iraq, along with their regional and global ramifications.

Due to the sensitivity of the topic, every and especially new users are strongly encouraged to read the rules and inform themselves of the conflict more generally before posting. The moderators enforce the relatively strict rules and it is strongly encouraged to put thought into one's activity on this subreddit. It is expected that user put back their individual bias as much as possible and respect other users no matter what background they're from.

We especially encourage critical and substantive on-topic discussion, as long as it is done in a civil and respectful manner to any other user of the community. This forum is especially useful for bringing in new perspectives to new users and provide new specific and circumstancial information. 

If there are questions, please contact the moderators via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsyriancivilwar) or ask in the Dumb Question tuesday threads. Other information can be found in our wiki. 

###SyrianCivilWar Rules

- The rules are relatively strict and should be followed as close as possible. Warnings are enforced by the moderators and depend on the context and a user's history; a similar offense may thus be met with very different responses based on the user that made it. Punishments will generally follow this scheme: 1. Warning -> 2. Warning -> 3. Warning and 3 day ban -> 4. Warning -> 5. Warning -> 6. 7 day ban and last warning -> 7. Permaban or longer ban. Mods will try to always give valid reason and reference to the rule that is being broken, but please keep in mind they are humans and make mistakes too. 

- It will frequently happen that threads get locked and entire comment chains removed without comment. Please understand that **it is your responsibility as a user to remain ""clean"" and contribute to this sub in a meaningful way.** Mods are not perfect and also operate under time constraints. 

- Appealing warnings and bans is only allowed via modmail, appeals via comments will be removed and ignored. **Do not PM mods about warnings/bans/post removals.** Please try to understand that mods will show little willingness to walk back on a punishment if your message is agitated, aggressive and uncivil. If you see any comments breaking the rules, please report them with the report button. A more extended version with explanations can be found on the subreddit wiki. 



- 1) **Civility.** Comments must be civil and respectful of other users. Ad hominem attacks, insults, flair-attacks, slander, etc. are impermissible. Do not ridicule opinions, personas, stances, or questions. 

- 2) **Editorialization.** The editorializing of titles to conform with these rules (especially tweets) is heavily encouraged. Inflammatory and biased wording is not allowed (incl: ""liberate"", ""terrorist"", ""hero""). Post/submission titles should thus be as informative and objective as possible. Exceptions can be made for *clearly marked quotes from individuals*. 

- 3) **Racism.** Any sort of racism or derogatory group-generalisation is not allowed. 

- 4) **Baiting.** Intentionally provocative or baiting comments targeting a particular user or the user-base are not allowed. This includes accusatory and inflammatory wording on comment (like: “butthurt” and “Are you serious?”). 

- 5) **Sarcasm and Cheerposting.** Light and friendly sarcasm is allowed. Excessive or mean-spirited sarcasm or snarkiness is not. Simple cheerposting, be it positive or negative, is not allowed. This includes insulting, judging or cheering for any side (RIP posts are allowed), player, or individual in the war. 

- 6) **Relevance and Derailing.** Any sort of derailing from the Syrian Civil War or issues directly related to it is not allowed. This includes the inner Turkey-PKK conflict, inner-US politics (“deep state”, the pro-Israel lobby). Exceptions will frequently be made for specific events. 

- 7) **Terminology.** Groups/factions/individuals have to be called as they'd call themselves. See clarification [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/7ca5jj/rule_7_clarification/). There will be no punishment for breaking only this rule.  

- 8) **Trivializing violence.** Dehumanising, death-wishing, and posts disrespecting the dead are not allowed. This includes joking or snarky comments and blame-trading. 

- 9) **Non-Substantive Comments.** Low-quality comments that contribute nothing to the conversation are heavily discouraged and will be removed. Borderline shitposting, strange formatting, memes and jokes, *talking/whining about votes and brigades* is not allowed unless specifically allowed. 

- 10) **Recruitment.** Any form of recruitment material concerning any party in the conflict is forbidden. A list of reputable charities can be found [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/wiki/charities).

- 11) **AMA** Any sort of AMA should be coordinated with the mods beforehand. Do this by sending a modmail. 

- 12) **Media Personalities.** This subreddit is about the Syrian Civil War and the involved actors, which includes twitter users and commentators. Discussion and posts regarding their reporting on the war or anything that could influence their bias is allowed; anything about other social media activity or their private life is not.

- 13) **Timeliness.** This subreddit is for discussion of current up-to-date events. Refrain from posting old articles dealing with past issues even if it wasn’t posted back then when it was relevant. Articles dealing with older events but with newly emerged evidence or relevant facts are allowed. 


- 14) **Mod actions** Accounts of inflammatory and baiting user names and suspected alt accounts may be banned on sight by moderators.

###For news and discussion of the entertainment industry. 

***
**Rules:**

1. **Off-topic posts** will be removed. Things that are entertaining (board games, video games, ""funny"" videos, etc) do not count as Entertainment News. 

  **Politicians** and members of the world's various **Royal Families** are not entertainers, please don't post about them here. People who were once actors but became Royals or politicians (e.g. Grace Kelly, Ronald Reagan, Meghan Markle) are excepted if the post is about their career in the entertainment industry. 

2. **Don't spam.** No one wants to see your YouTube video about 
""Sexy Office Romance Stripping"" or the ""Best hair shaving prank 2018 ( gone wrong)"". Don't even think about posting your blogspam, YouTube spam, or domain spam here, thank you.

3. **Abusive comments.** If there's a point you want to make please do so, but **name-calling or verbal abuse may result in a ban**. Use the report function to flag abusive comments rather than responding and escalating. 

4. **Trolls and brigaders** will be banned summarily.

5. **Racism and hate speech** will not be allowed. Those making such comments will be banned. **Sexist language** will not be tolerated. 

6. **Misinformation**. Deliberately spreading or repeating misinformation will result in a ban. This includes but is not limited to  unfounded allegations about celebrities and denial of COVID‑19 safety measures.

7. **Editorialized titles**. Posts with editorialized titles may be removed. 

8. **Topics already submitted**. Check to see if content has already been shared prior submitting your post. Continued violations of this rule may result in a ban.

---
Although the **culture wars** will not be won in this subreddit, it is OK to discuss differing viewpoints. However - it is not OK to comment in a way designed to provoke those who don't share your views (see Rule 4, above). A thoughtful and articulate comment might even convince someone of your sincerity and desire to make the world a better place. Above all,  please remember to be respectful and considerate. Thanks!

34,PoliticalHumor,r/PoliticalHumor 2024: The Sequel Nobody Asked For,"A subreddit focused on US politics, and the ridiculousness surrounding them.","#####A subreddit for political humor (specifically US politics), such as political cartoons and satire[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)

Please link to the source whenever possible.

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts should be regarding U.S. politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly. 

     Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, leftists, etc!), but please keep posts civil. 

2. **Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.** 

 **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.

 If it's isn't funny (or at least trying to be), we'll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)

 If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. 

 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a ""flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn"" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.


3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** 

    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. 

4. **Images & short GIFs only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.

    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  

    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within ""allowed"" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** 

 Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. 

 Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  

6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, including use of ""tard"" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. 

  If you're intentionally trolling, including ""google games,"" you will be banned. 

7. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. 

 ___7b.___  **No ""Meta"" Posts.**

 Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.


8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 

9. **No pointing at offsite resources**

  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.

  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.

###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderation actions are done at each moderator's own discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message and we'll take a look at why you were banned for you. Contrition will play in your favor if you were banned for violating our rules. 

* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)

###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#1. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#2. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#4. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#7. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#9. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.
](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)

#10. No Self Promotion

* *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.""* - Confucius

* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.

####Posting Rules

\- all posts and discussions must be relevant to women's issues

\- promoting regressive agendas is not permitted

\- be respectful and courteous

\- respect the ""assume good faith"" principle
 
[Click here for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/about/rules)

**Rules regarding debating**:

Criticism of feminist concepts/organizations/persons is **welcomed** if it meets the following criteria:

\- it is topical/directly relevant to the topic at hand;

\- it is verifiably sourced (i.e. it doesn’t rely on mere dismissiveness/speculation, non-feminist preferences or anecdotal evidence. In particular, pure anti-feminist propaganda is not allowed, since personal non-/anti-feminist preferences are deemed as not informative or relevant); furthermore, presentation of relevant data must not be biased against the feminist position (i.e. there should be a best effort to include the evidence/arguments supportive of the feminist position);

\- it is properly qualified: i.e. it correctly identifies the problem at the appropriate level, instead of unwarrantably generalizing it, especially if it does so for the whole collection of movements that constitute feminism;

\- all ideological considerations must contribute to understanding the feminist perspective, and be consistent with an attitude of encouragement towards further learning."

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

""Showerthought"" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. 

**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) before submitting.**

**Please read [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) before messaging the moderators.**

## Rules  

- **1. All content must be original and unique.**    
Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on Reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_all_content_must_be_original_and_unique.)

For an explanation of what a showerthought actually is (and is not), please read [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).

You may include examples, explanations, or further information in the body section, but all posts to /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own as nothing but a title.

Thoughts directly related to being in the shower (or anything related to the bathroom) will be removed. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22shower_observations..22)

- **5. No jokes, puns, wordplay, or submissions which are dependent on definitions, mechanisms, or oddities in language.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.22wordplay.3F.22)

54,newyork,New York State,,"### **Welcome to /r/NewYork!**

### **The Empire State**

## About New York

New York is a state in the Northeastern region of the United States. New York is the 27th-most extensive, the third-most populous, and the seventh-most densely populated of the 50 United States. New York is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south and by Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont to the east. The state has a maritime border with Rhode Island east of Long Island, as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Ontario to the west and north, and Quebec to the north. The state of New York is often referred to as New York State, so as to distinguish it from New York City.

A startled cat is dynamic and in motion. Gifs and videos should convey motion - leaping, jumping or otherwise showing that unique feline panic that makes us laugh, point and reach for our cameras. Videos and gifs, of course, do that best.

**If you need to explain that a cat is startled, it is not startled.**"

That's right, we had mixed results from middle fingers so now we're going to give the finger to dust and grime! Cleanse the world! Show the world your cleansing and how pure you are going to make your space! Get all the toxins out of your air because its YOUR breathing room! 

Do NOT message us directly for your approval until you make a post HERE:

##About

This subreddit is for pictures of innocent things that appear to be racist in a certain connotation. 

Some examples of what accidental racism could be are:

* Wording that came out wrong.
* Ironic pictures.
* Something that just didn't come out like expected.

##Rules and Regulations

***I.* No intentional racism!** Intentional racism and bigotry of any kind will be met with an immediate and permanent ban. 

***II.* Not just accidental racism:** Accidental sexism, or any other accidential -ism is also permitted. 

***III.* Crossposts and reposts:** Crossposting is allowed. Reposts from the last 90 days or the top 50 of all time are not. 

***IV.* No fakes or staged photos:** Content must be genuine; no photoshopped pictures or staged situations for karma. This ain't /r/4chan.  

***V.* NSFW content must be tagged.**

***VI.*Adhere to [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/).** Be civil, no doxxing, brigading, et cetera. 


***VII.* No complaining:** Do not complain that in some contexts the accidental racism is innocent or tenuous, or not actually racist. We know. It's accidental. Nothing here is actually racist. Leave that to /r/iamverysmart.

***VIII.* No critical race discussion posts:** The subject and study of critical race theory is a serious topic, however, this is not a serious subreddit. It's primarily a humor subreddit. In light of that, critical race discussions do not belong here. 

***IX.* Swastika posts.** In the Western world, specifically North America, swastikas are associated with Nazism, Neo-Nazism, and other offshoots. These posts are allowed. Items that are mildly swastika, or only kinda sorta look like one belong in /r/accidentalswastika or /r/mildlyswastika. 

***X.* No ""N"", KKK or Negro posts.** ""N"", ""Nig"", Negro and KKK posts, there are a lot of these and there are no variations between the one and the other.

***XI.* Cleaning Posts Only.** Only post things about cleaning, purification, cleansing, and removing unwanted filth. This rule supersedes all other rules.  This is a Texan rule and Texas has ruled that it cannot be censored under the law.

---

### Please note the subs rules

**1. Mark all NSFW submissions NSFW.**

Any post featuring nudity or anything considered risqué should be marked NSFW.




**2. Celebs must be 18 or older**

All image or videos must be a celeb who was 18 or older at the time it was taken.

If your account does not meet these criteria, you'll need to wait 3-10 days and comment around reddit to gain positive comment karma. 

**4. Don't flood the sub with submissions**

Please only three submission per 12 hours. If you're frequently submitting the same obscure website or blog, you may be banned for spam.

**5. Do not excessively editorialize your post titles**

Just tell us who or what you're posting as concisely as possible without adding unnecessary information.

**6. We will aggressively remove [Self-Promotional Links](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and Blogspam**

Please use mainstream, high-quality sources for mainstream celebrity news.  Low-quality posts and blogspam will be removed and submitters blocked from further low-quality submissions. 

**7. No fake pictures or videos allowed**

> * We're here to have a laugh.

> * Follow the general Advice Animal format: Two line joke over a re-usable character.  
> * *Hate speech, bigotry, and personal attacks are not allowed.* *Participating in or starting witch hunts are forbidden.* ***Death threats and telling others to kill themselves will result in a ban.*** 
> * Don't repost. Report reposts by messaging the mods.

> * No [Verticals](/r/vertical), [Opinion Puffins](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/unpopular-opinion-puffin) or [Batman Slaps](http://www.reddit.com/r/batmanslap). Two Advice Animals in a vertical are OK.  
> * Don't make memes with pics of people that you saw in real life. Ever.  
> * Link directly to your image. Shortened links, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogspot, etc, will be automatically removed. 
> * Don't post COVID or anti-vax misinformation - Healthy skepticism and debate are allowed (and encouraged!), but anti-science nonsense has no place on this subreddit or anywhere else on this site. Denial of the plethora of evidence that vaccination is safe and effective is not a reasonable or rational position to take.

75,TopMindsOfReddit,Top. Minds.,"""I think the problem Digg had is that it was a company that was built to be a company, and you could feel it in the product. The way you could criticize Reddit is that we weren't a company – we were all heart and no head for a long time. So I think it'd be really hard for me and for the team to kill Reddit in that way.""

--Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, April 2023","[Look, you may be new here, but /r/TopMindsOfReddit is where many top-of-minds collaborate and routinely outsmart the most well-funded, well equipped, and diabolical subreddits on earth. How do we do it? Top shitposters, brigaders on every sub, unparalleled circlejerking skills, and fearlessness. I would trust a top comment here over pretty much any racist sub, especially a default, any day.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3ja7ls/you_tried_so_hard_to_claim_reuropean_wasnt/cunkmna)

Was 9/11 an inside job? Does Obama work for the space lizards? Is the fluoride in our drinking water a mind-control drug? TopMindsOfReddit is a subreddit for chronicling the adventures of Reddit's boldest truth seekers in their quest to awaken the obsequious masses. While /r/conspiracy is the natural place to observe expert investigators hard at work exposing The Truth, links to comments and threads anywhere on Reddit are welcome.

[Reddit's conspiracy subreddit is owned by the alt right](https://thisinterestsme.com/r-conspiracy-reddit/)

--------------------------

[](/sidebar)

> **Rules**

1. No brigading. Do not call for brigading in any shape or form. This includes vote brigading (encouraging people to vote on linked material) or comment brigading (encouraging people to comment in linked threads). **Do not participate in showcased comment threads. Don't Vote; Don't Comment; Don't Subscribe** 

2. No pretending Breitbart is actual news. Seriously, how fucking stupid do you have to be?

3. No hate speech. No slurs, hate speech, or racism. It will earn you a one-way ticket to Bansville. It's like white lines. Don't do it!

4. Posts must directly involve a conspiracy theory posted **on Reddit**.  **Posts about general racism, sexism, or other bigotry** are better suited for subreddits such as /r/isrconspiracyracist, /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, /r/TheTopMinds, /r/worstof, or /r/ShitRedditSays. No Facebook / Twitter / YouTube comments / screenshots.

5. Agitated conspiracy wingnuts will only be allowed if they are entertaining. **This rule will be enforced arbitrarily and without warning.**

6. Excessive retroactive editing of your posts is frowned upon. Especially if used to shift the goalposts. This entirely depends on how entertaining you are.

7. RULE NINE IS THE ONE TRUE RULE

8. Excessive Username Pinging: Don't Do It.  

9. Rule 9 (or Rule Se7en) : Participate at your own risk. We might ban you just because we feel like it.

10. Screenshots must be verifiable. **If you post a screenshot, you must also comment with a link to the item you screenshot**, so that the moderators and/or users can verify the accuracy of the screenshot. ( or the URL has to be in the screenshot but that's just more work for us, so comment anyway). If the thing you screenshot: isn't public, never went live, or has been removed by moderators - we don't want it.

-While we welcome debate, stories and comments that are *demonstrably* false and/or make substantial allegations without credible evidence (e.g., ""Obama still won't show us his birth certificate"", or ""It is well known that Obama was raised as a SUNNI MUSLIM"", or ""Obama is secretly gay"", etc), and racist slurs and racially tinged commentary will be removed, and are grounds for an instant ban. 

-Satire, gags, memes, image macros, animated GIFs, and videos that simply use the President's likeness are not considered ""news and information about Obama"".

-Posts should be about *recent news and information* directly related Barack Obama.

-No editorialized titles, spam, or reposts.

-No URL shorteners or archive links.

-No posts that are primarily about Trump.

-No posts that are primarily about Biden's Presidency.

-No posts just about Joe Biden, or about Joe Biden invoking the legacy of the Obama presidency.

-No posts that are *just* about /r/ObamaCare (ACA - Affodable Care Act) that don't have any direct involvement by Barack Obama.

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 

##4. Flair

* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).

##5. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). 

* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.

* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time.

###Community guidelines

* Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
* News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.
* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
* No referral links in submissions.
* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like ""Buying 100 BTC"" or ""Selling my computer for bitcoins"" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.
* Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from *new* merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider [Reddit's self-serve advertising system](https://ads.reddit.com).
* Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.
* Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

###Why Monero?

[](/r/monero#secure)

**Monero is secure.**

Monero can't be hacked to steal your funds, due to the power of distributed consensus. This means that you are responsible for your own money, and don't have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you.

[](/r/monero#private)

**Monero is private.**

The power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero's sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs.

[](/r/monero#untraceable)

**Monero is untraceable.**

By taking advantage of ring signatures, Monero makes it ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to any particular user.

[](/r/monero#fungible)

**Monero is fungible.**

Because of its on-by-default privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, which means that one Monero will always be equal to another. This ensures that there will be no discrimination over the origin or history of your coins, lessening the worry of potential blacklisting by exchanges or vendors.

###Guidelines
1. **Breaking the guidelines may result in a deleted post and possible ban.**
2. Discussion of using Monero to break the law is disallowed.
3. Follow redditquette and the rules of reddit.
4. Only Monero-related topics/links, and no referral links.
5. No memes/image macros or low-effort/AI-generated content.
6. If you have any affiliation with an exchange, product or service that's being discussed, you must disclose that information. Advertisement can occur every two weeks at most.
7. When mentioning other currencies, keep the discussion civil. No zealotry.
8. No posts on how many coins you own/lost.
9. Please direct support questions to r/monerosupport.
10. For price/valuation talk, please use /r/xmrtrader.
11. Religion related posts are off-topic.

> Suicide is a very serious matter; it cannot be undone. If you're feeling suicidal, you need to talk to someone. Even if there is no one in real life, there are thousands of teenagers who feel the same way and can talk you out of it. Or, if you would rather talk to an adult, there's /r/suicidewatch. Suicide is never the best solution. Remember that you are loved, always.

102,lgbt,r/lgbt: Reddit's home for the LGBTQ+ community,"A safe space for GSRM (Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minority) folk to discuss their lives, issues, interests, and passions. LGBT is still a popular term used to discuss gender and sexual minorities, but all GSRM are welcome beyond lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people who consent to participate in a safe space.","#Want Flair?

Click the (edit) button ⇧ up above!

[](/safe-space)

#### [](#h4-green)

>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:

-------------


# Rules

---

>###1: Be respectful   
No GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: ""[TW] Title of Post"". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.

---

>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   
Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just ""shouldn't be so sensitive."" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. 

---

>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   
Bait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.

---

>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   
r/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.

---

>###5: No survey and research requests   
We are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.

---

>###6: No promoting hate   
Having posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.

---

>###7: Don't share hate speech    
r/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.

---

>###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   
Please send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.

---

>###9: NSFW Content.   
r/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.

---

>###10: Provide sources when sharing news
We require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.

---

>###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.
These posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.

---

>###12: Moderator Discretion.
Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.

>###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.
If you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.

### Please read the rules:

1. Submissions must be explicitly about a single gadget. (Posts about software or tech companies will be removed. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).

2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with. Native advertising and ""advertorials"" are also not allowed.

3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: 
   - The article must be from a white listed source.
   - The article must be about the gadget, not the company, its business practices, or delivery dates etc.
   - The submitter must not be affiliated with the campaign, company or website

4. No direct image links.

5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles. 

6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.

8. No Adult Material.

9. English only.

10. If you need advice about a gadget you should ask in the advice [superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky?num-1). However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. 

11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. 

12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).

### Moderation Policy

## We use the [reddit FAQ guidelines for spam](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) when removing spam posts. Additionally, we use a [whitelist system](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist).

## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.

110,HereComesTheBoom,Hard Hits in Sports,Hard hits during sporting events,"Share hard hits or ""booms"" that occur during sporting events.

##The Rulebook

1. The post must include a hit as defined as follows:
  - It must be a collision between at least two entities.
  - It occurs via a [sporting activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport).
  - It involves at least one player, coach, referee, or other standard participant. A fan does not satisfy this criterion.
  - It is more significant than an obvious [flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flop_(basketball\)) or [dive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(association_football\)).
2. The post must (preferably though not necessarily directly) be a link to a picture or video. GIFs qualify as videos.
3. Do not post exceedingly NSFL hits.

##Strategies

- You can assign the link flair yourself or one of the moderators will get around to doing it for you. We prefer that you don't include it in the title since it just takes up unnecessary space.
- GIFs and pictures generally get more attention than videos, especially from mobile users, so we encourage sharing those if possible. Perhaps you can reap in double karma for including the video in a comment.
- Try to provide a link at which the hit happens within just a few seconds or at least indicate in the title how far into the video the hit is.

# The Few Rules:

* **Vine Confidentiality**:
You are not allowed to share here any non-public information about any vine products or vine program. If you need to discuss confidential information, join [discord](https://discord.gg/amazonvine) or one of the other member-only groups.

* **Treat others how you would like to be treated**: 
Simple, treat others how you would like to be treated. For example, if you have a problem with someone commenting on your dietary preferences, then do not comment on others' dietary preferences.

* **Be respectful to EVERYONE!** If you have any question as to whether or not you should post something, then you probably should not post it. If you do not know what is considered ""respectful"", then please reach out to a Moderator and we will discuss it with you.

* **Bullying and/or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated!**
This includes, but is not limited to: --> Political beliefs --> Race / ethnicity --> Gender / identity --> Religion --> Personal values

* **If you can't take jokes, don't make jokes.** If you are sensitive to people making jokes about you, then you should not be making jokes about others. Refer to Rule #2. Have fun, laugh, and try not to take internet things seriously!

* **Neither end well on the internet.** No exceptions! We will not discuss anything regarding politics or religion. There will be no warnings before deletion of these kinds of posts.

* **No spam, soliciting, trolling, or griefing.** Do not spam, try to sell things, post things specifically to get on peoples' nerves, etc. Refer to Rule #3.

* **Please utilize search function before posting!** Reddit can get a bit congested pretty quickly. If you have any questions or concerns that you want to post about, please refer to FAQ first, then utilize the search function to see if your question has already been discussed. Moderators reserve the right to lock or delete posts for topics that have already been answered multiple times.

* **Please keep it PG!** Since this is a public Reddit, please minimize the use of profanity, sexual innuendo, discussion of drugs, or any other behavior that could be considered not appropriate for all ages.

115,WWE,The Subreddit for WWE ,"Welcome to r/WWE

A SubReddit to discuss WWE, NXT, ECW, and WCW.","##**Wrestling Discord**

One of the members of r/WWE made a discord to discuss WWE and other wrestling promotions.  As this serves as the discord that r/WWE will promote, don't promote your discords on our sub - do that elsewhere.

https://discord.gg/BHtfy9pUz5

##**Related Subs**

WWE Video Games:  http://www.reddit.com/r/wwegames

WWE Memes:  http://www.reddit.com/r/wwememes

Fantasy Booking/""How I Would Change..."":  http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking

##**Subreddit Rules**

* **FOLLOW THE SITE WIDE RULES:** Please try to adhere to the general spirit of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [Reddit Site Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) - remember that there's a human behind the screen!  If you have issues with r/WWE rules, message the moderators to address.

* **SPOILER POLICY:** Spoiler times run for 24 hours after a TV show or PPV ends.  Anything that takes place on a TV show or PPV is a spoiler.  It does not matter if it is a “real life event”, if it occurs on a live show or PPV, or is mentioned on a live show or PPV, it meets our definition of “spoiler”.  If you post a spoiler, TAG YOUR POST as a spoiler.  Do not post spoilers in the title of your posts.  Do not post a photo with a spoiler, as not all platforms will hide the photo.  While a TV show or live event is in progress, we create a discussion thread for the live event or PPV that is in progress.  

* **WHY CAN'T I POST?** When a show is live (TV/PPV/ETC), we lock the sub (until the next morning) so posts aren't allowed.  This avoids spoilers for those who don't watch live.  If you can't post, look to see if a show or PPV is airing live, and that's why.

* **NO TROLLING:** Trolling is an instant ban.  This includes on the sub and in the chat room.  This also includes ""WWE sucks, X promotion is better"" trolling.  

* **REPORT OFFENSIVE/SPAMMY/BAD CONTENT:** This subreddit will be a better environment for new/discussion if substandard content is reported. You can send a link to the content via modmail or use Reddit's reporting system to report a post.  This sub does not allow racist, offensive or pornographic content, including memes.

* **RESPECT OTHERS**: r/WWE does not tolerate bigotry, sexism, racism, homophobia, or transphobia against members, or wrestlers.  This includes discussion of male/female violence.  We also do not tolerate disrespect or attacks towards r/WWE staff and admins.  Disrespecting users will result in a 1 day ban.  Disrespecting or attacking moderators and admins will result in a ban.  Disrespecting r/WWE or r/WWE staff on others subs or your personal account/profile will result in a perma ban.  Also, attacking people because they like more than just WWE will result in a ban.  People are allowed to enjoy and consume any content they desire, and we will not stand for attacks on those who enjoy other promotions.

* **""SHITPOSTING"", KARMA FARMING & UNRELATED POSTS/MEMES/APPROPRIATE CONTENT/SEXUALIZING TALENT**: Do not post random stuff just for karma.  This especially applies to dumb memes that have nothing to do with anything. Admins and moderators reserve the right to remove memes that seem to be pointless.  Continued ""shitposting"" will result in a ban. If it doesn't feel like it belongs here, it goes to r/WWEMemes.  Also, this isn't a game sub. Video game stuff goes to r/WWEGames.  Also, this sub doesn't exist to sexualize women, nor to comment on the appearance of WWE female performers (""hot"", ""sexy"", etc).  It's not a sub for ""thirst traps"", or to post horny pics.  There are multiple other subs to obsess over women's bodies, or ""who was the hottest"" / ""who's the hottest"", we don't do that here.  

* **NO STREAMING SITES:** Do not ask for, post or share links to sites streaming PPVs and shows.  Links will be deleted as spam and those sharing/asking for illegal stream links will be banned.

* **SELF PROMOTION POLICY:** This subreddit does not allow self promotion.  Do not use r/wwe to promote your social media, blog, website, Twitch, Discord, YouTube channel, or podcast.  Violators will be banned.  

* **NO POLITICS:**  This is a forum for discussion of r/wwe.  Regardless of whether or not a US President has been related to WWE in some form, we do not allow political discussion here.  There are plenty of subs out there for that.  The only exception is when politics has a **direct effect** on WWE, such as Florida declaring WWE an essential business during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.

* **MAJOR TOPICS/MEGATHREADS:** When a major event occurs, megathreads will be created to group discussion so they don't overtake the sub.  All related discussion (predictions, etc) should be kept in this threads and individual created threads will be locked/removed.  If a thread is locked/deleted and the user posts it again, this may lead to a ban.  Those who disrespect, attack, or insult mods, staff, or the r/WWE sub for organizing minor threads into a megathread will receive a 7 day ban.

* **LEAKED RESULTS:** Do not post leaked results of taped shows.

* **SELLING:** Don't use r/WWE to sell your stuff or link to your auctions.  This is a discussion forum, not a platform for you to sell your stuff.

* **REPOSTING REMOVED POSTS:** If your post is removed, don't repost it, or post ""why was my post removed"".  Review the sub's rules, or PM admin/mod staff at r/WWE to inquire.

* **AEW Discussion:** Per the results of [a vote by members of this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/paxacg/regarding_aew_discussion_on_rwwe/), limited AEW discussion is allowed only if it is **extremely relevant** to WWE.  This includes legitimate comparisons, as well as major WWE superstars debuting in AEW.  AEW trolling will not be tolerated and those who do so will be banned.

###### Rules:
>
> Rule | Description
:--|:--
**Follow the Reddit Content Policy** | You can find it [here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). TL;DR: If you can't say something respectfully, don't say it at all. Insults and personal attacks aren't welcome here.
**Post should be about hardware**| Posts should be about hardware news, reviews, technical discussion or how-tos and buyers guides.
**No editorializing titles**| Please use the ""suggest title"" button for link submissions, or copy the title of the original link. Do NOT editorialize the title of the submission; (minor) changes for clarity may be acceptable if the original title is clickbait, or failed to summarize its actual content.
**Original Source Policy**| Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information. Exceptions can be made for content in foreign language or any other exceptional cases. Fully paywalled articles are not allowed. Please contact the moderators through modmail if you have questions.
**No memes, jokes, or direct links to images** | Memes, direct image links, and low effort content will be removed. This includes both posts and comments. Images submitted as self posts must include an informative description for context. Top level comments must be substantive and contain more than 20 characters.
**No tech support or PC building questions** | These belong in /r/techsupport, /r/buildapc or any relevant tech subreddits. If your post asks a question about a specific product or need, it probably belongs elsewhere. This includes 'What should I buy?', 'Does a ____ do what I need?', 'How much is _____ worth?' and 'How long until (something obvious) happens?' type questions.
**Serious and intelligent discussion** | We allow discussion posts on relevant topics to hardware; there should however be at least background information and relevancy to demonstrate such a discussion is worthwhile. Low effort posts such as ""What is ______ and what does it do?"" is not acceptable.
**Rumor Policy** | **No unsubstantiated rumors** - Rumors or other claims/information not directly from official sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed.
**Misc. Rules** | No content behind paywalls. No submissions to streaming sites outside of event megathreads. No submissions to crowdfunding sites or ongoing campaigns. No bots.



##### Spam and Self Promotion:
>

124,usanews,USA News,,"**OUR RULES**:

#***MAKE NO MORE THAN 10 SUBMISSIONS IN ANY 24-HOUR PERIOD.***

*Moderators have discretion to remove submissions, comments or users that violate these rules.*

Don’t post submissions that are not about news pertaining to the US or its territories. (Consider the subreddit title: ”***USA***News”.)

**Submission titles**: Don’t editorialize titles. Stick to the published title as much as possible. Ask what you want or make your point in a comment, *not* in the submission title. Avoid “clickbait”ish titles. Don’t use a title that does not concisely summarize the submission. (People should be able to know what it is about without clicking on the submission.) DO NOT USE ALL CAPITAL LETTERS IN THE TITLE (even if that's the way it appears as published). ***NO EMOJIS IN TITLES!***

Don’t post highly partisan political news or advocacy posts. 
[Submissions or comments that ask readers to make a donation, sign a petition, or spread the word about a particular cause are considered *advocacy posts*, and will be removed by the moderators.]

***DON'T SPAM*** (This includes self-promoting submissions/comments.)  ***Spammers may be banned, even if no prior warning has been given.***

No blogspam

Don’t post spammy, unoriginal content 

***DO NOT SOLICIT DONATIONS FOR ANY CAUSE, POST PETITIONS OR CALL FOR CONCERTED ACTION*** (These sorts of posts are considered *advocacy posts* and will be removed. Please down vote and report these posts.)

**Don’t post archived articles (or reddit.com [or redd.it] links); use the original source**

Don’t post articles that are not true, even if it is “satire” or “humor”. **Don't post articles that are “satire” or “humor”.**

No subreddit drama. (Don’t post about having something removed from, or being banned from, any subreddit.)

Don’t post unnecessarily rude, antagonistic, ad hominem, or off-topic comments

Comments that detract from meaningful, civil, intelligent discussion (including trolling, name-calling, bigoted and ad hominem comments) will be removed. ***DON’T TROLL***. ***NO PERSONAL ATTACKS. (Attack the message, not the messenger.)*** Those so commenting may be banned, without prior warning. *”But he/she/whomsoever did it” isn’t an excuse.* Rather than responding to such comments, use the report button to report them to the moderators (providing a link).

**DON’T STALK**. 

Don’t bring disputes from another subreddit into this one.

**Don’t use gratuitous and/or unnecessary profanity**

**DO NOT POST ANYTHING WITH (OR SOLICIT) PERSONAL INFORMATION**, whether of yourself or others. They will be removed subject to moderator discretion. 

**DON’T COMPLAIN ABOUT A NEWS** ***SOURCE***. (Comments about submission *content* are fine. Comments like ""NY Times/National Review: LOL"" will be removed.)

**NO DIRECT SUBMISSIONS THAT LINK ONLY TO AN IMAGE OR VIDEO** (Imgur, Tinypic, YouTube, i.redd.it, v.redd.it, snapchat.com,
etc.). -- Post an article, and submit the image or video as a comment.

Bot-generated comments will be removed and the bot banned.

#***USERS WHO HAVE DISABLED MODERATOR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING THEIR POSTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO POST.***

***

#***IF REPORTING SOMETHING, be specific about what rule is being violated.*** ""See the sidebar"" or something like that is of little value.

***

#***PAYWALL ISSUES?*** There is such a thing as a library, or a newsstand, or even a subscription.  (**Handy Helpful Hint**: you can often get around the paywall by doing an internet search for the title.)

> ##About
> This subreddit is dedicated to showcasing interesting and entertaining chemical reactions. [Read our Wiki for more information on the types of posts you will see here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/wiki/index). Due to our subreddit's size and variety of interesting gifs, over time this we have grown to be accommodating to other types of chemistry, physics and biology related gifs (those who would just like to view one type may use our filters on this sidebar).

---

> ##Rules
>1. **Physical reactions are allowed**, along with an extension of other gifs that we feel relevant to this subreddit which you can read about in our wiki [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/wiki/index) under the ""Post Categories"" section. **Posts will be tagged accordingly based on what category they fall under.**
>
>2. **Not every post that is not a chemical reaction is a physical reaction** or relevant to this subreddit's accepted posts. For example a post featuring a can being smashed or the motion of a pendulum will be removed.
>
>3. **All link posts must be in either gif or html5 format.** Any link post that is not in one of these formats will be deleted. Any interesting or relevant images or videos (whether they be about the subreddit or a demonstration) must be done in a self post.
>
>4. **No albums of gifs allowed in link post or self post form.** This is due to trouble categorizing a post which often has multiple gifs that don't fall under one category and leads to a misleading post and confusion.
>
>5. **Reposts are allowed and will be tagged as such for filtering sake.** They will not be removed unless a moderator deems the repost to be of a demonstration or particular gif that has been posted too often (e.g. Mercury(II) Thiocyanate Decomposition).
>
>6. **All link posts must have the source of the gif/html5 video posted in the comments.** We expect the original poster to do this, however if someone else does so then it will not be removed. Reposts of a post with a source that do not contain the source in the comments will be deleted.
>
>7. **Link posts utilizing the gif/html5 format to skirt the rules will be removed.** For example if a demonstration is posted that is a gif but is essentially static image then it will be removed. We will approach this rule on a case-by-case basis to avoid removing naturally slow/lengthy demonstrations to the best of our ability. 
>
>*In rare cases, exceptions may be made by the moderators if a post is exceptionally intriguing and relevant to discussion in order to maintain quality standards.*

It recognized the legitimacy of ""Stop and Identify"" statutes, but with the prerequisite that the stop was a legitimate ""Terry Stop"" based upon ""reasonable articulable suspicion"". ***Hiibel* does not authorize police to demand ID without cause.**

- [Reasonable suspicion/RAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_suspicion) - An explanation of the standard required for a ""Terry Stop"".

- [Probable Cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause) - This is the standard which is required for an arrest, warrant, criminal charge or a search which goes above and beyond an officer safety pat-down.

**Above all else, remember this when dealing with police**:

Police are not required to explain themselves or their actions to you or any other person they detain or arrest. A failure to explain their actions to a citizen, either out of malice or ignorance, does not mean a lawful order can be ignored. They are only required to justify their actions in criminal and/or civil court. **Do not mistake a lack of explanation for a lack of grounds**. Only refuse to identify yourself if you are absolutely certain you stand on solid legal ground. 

Do not attempt to stand up to police officers if you aren't equipped with enough knowledge to make a safe determination of what you're legally required to do and are prepared to endure a false arrest and charges. Any and all resistance must be passive. Never physically resist an officer (exceptions for extraordinarily extra-legal actions notwithstanding). If your rights are violated, seeking compensation will be hampered by any ""bad"" behavior on your part. Don't make your lawyer's job harder than it has to be."
137,Blackpeople,r/Blackpeople,"An open place for black people to discuss what they feel is important. For us, by us, love us!!!!!","Hello! Welcome to /r/Blackpeople, our own little corner of Reddit.

There are definitely some ground rules to keep in mind here. First, posts and comments **are manually approved by a moderator** in order to keep the racist scum that permeates Reddit as far away as possible. So, if you post something that doesn't appear right away, have patience. Contact the mod team if you have any questions.

""Not being racist"" is not the only bar of quality, however; the content should have some value for the subscribers. This goes without saying: **some amount of civility is required of everyone.** That includes YOU, no matter who you are, how you feel, whoever is out there that you don't like. YOU will stay within the lines and respect moderator discretion. This is not a place for your personal war on your enemies.

Politics is a tricky issue, and we try to be accommodating to all manner of opinions. But it's been clear that /r/Blackpeople gets a lot of eyes, only some of them attached to black faces, and people will try to 'astroturf' or push their agenda to a black audience.

Remember: On this sub, you're trading off some satisfaction of your post being visible right away to ensure a safe, well-curated discussion board for you and everyone else. Lots of people on the Internet have confused discussion with stupidity and arguing, so keep in mind that **participating is a *privilege* on this sub.**

In fact, there's a saying: ""Come informed but also ready to listen."" A lot of people think that they're informed and God's gift to everyone else, so it's up to the moderators to filter the acidic and the mundane, and it's up to the community to be mature about differences of opinion. And remember, it's just Reddit."

# Comment and submission rules

1) **Be civil**

Do not be abusive or offensive to any user regardless of differences of opinion. Memes and joke comments are not allowed. 

2) **Maintain scientific integrity**

#[**Rules for Submissions**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules)

I. **Titles**

1. All titles must begin with [PsBattle:](/submit/?title=PsBattle:%20)

    This *is* case sensitive and must include a space after the colon.

2. Titles must *objectively describe* the subject of the image.

    2.1. No jokes, editorialising, or giving background info. The quality of the image is more important than how catchy the title is. 

    2.2. Requests, such as ""Please photoshop me or my friend"", are not permitted. Please review our suggestions below for an appropriate subreddit.

    2.3. Questions, such as ""Where else could he be?"" are not permitted.

    2.4. No personal anecdotes or mention of your connection to the image.

    2.5. No clichés such as ""this has potential"", ""make this epic"", ""This cat/dog/baby"", or ""My friend/daughter/son..."".  

II. **Image content**

1. Submissions must be a *direct* link to a *single* image. Albums and paneled/tiled images will be removed.

2. Images must be reasonable quality.

    2.1. Images must be at least 600x600 pixels (360,000 pixels total).
 
    2.2. No [technically low-quality images.](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules#wiki_reasons_for_these_rules)

    2.3. Images must be relatively well framed, and free from noise, blur, and distortion.

3. No disallowed image content.

    3.1. No photos of tv screens / computer monitors / physical pictures / billboards / magazines, etc.

    3.2. Images centered around text or signs may be removed.

    3.3. No phone / computer screenshots.

4. Images that have already been photoshopped may be removed, including images with watermarks, logos, or added text.

5. Images that have active threads, or have been photoshopped here, or elsewhere, may be removed.

6. If the mods believe that someone would object to having their image photoshopped or shared (no snapchats), it may be removed.

7. Sexually suggestive and overly gory submissions may be removed. 

**Deleting submissions with work in the comment section is not tolerated, and will result in a permanent submission ban.**

#[**Rules for Commenting**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content. 

Comments that are cliché, karma chains, not an original photoshop, memes, reaction gifs, upvote gifs, or off topic are *subject to removal by the moderators without notification.*

NSFW tags must be used *generously*.

**Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.**

[*Link to comment rules page.*](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

---

**Voting**

Please upvote based on quality of work. **Lazy** shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh.

Please do not downvote *submissions* just because they do not have obvious potential.

---

Please [report](http://i.imgur.com/DYBtk.png) inappropriate content to the mods.

In addition to reddit's global rules, /r/creepy enforces the following:




**1\. NOT CREEPY DON'T POST IT!** Insufficiently creepy submissions will be removed at moderator's discretion. Generally speaking, if it can work as a post on a comedy or a cute subreddit, it doesn't belong here. Abandoned buildings without a creepy context will be directed elsewhere.   

If a post is *completely* off topic, please report the post and [**message the mods.**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy)

**2\. Do NOT complain ""That's not creepy!""** in the comments or in post titles. Defamation of the subreddit itself and those who disregard the sidebar rules will be banned permanently. As a counterbalance against rule #2, keep in mind that different people are creeped out by different things, and suspension of disbelief helps the atmosphere. Just downvote and move on, or upstage them by [**submitting something even creepier.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/submit ""You know you want to."") You'll notice the loudest complainers never actually submit anything good themselves. The health of any subreddit depends on users like you submitting quality content and the community voting wisely.

**3\. No pictures of costumes, makeup, or children's art.** From October 1-31 there will be a ""Halloween Megathread"" where the costume rule will be lifted in said thread. However comments will be closely monitored.

**4\. No memes, religious discussions, or politics.** Post content of that nature in their specific subreddits, this place isn't for comedy it's not a church or a place to discuss politicians.  
 

**5\. No imgur gallery links!**  Instead, use direct imgur image links or album links (http://i.imgur.com/EXAMPLE.png or http://i.imgur.com/a/EXAMPLE instead of http://imgur.com/gallery/EXAMPLE, for example) as they're easier for mobile and RES users to open. 

**6\. No Comment Spam.** Take the I took an arrow to the knee or hell in a cell comments elsewhere. If you persist with said comments you will receive a 3 day ban as a warning. 

* If you see any rule violations, please [**message the mods**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy) and we'll look into it as soon as possible. Please include a link of the

RULES
--
* **Every post must contribute to the discussion of the Olympics**
 * We do not care about how tenuous the connection is other than the below.
* **No [Redditquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) Violations**
 * No threats, personal invective, or personal insults.
 * No racist, sexist, or homophobic slurs.
 * No bashing athletes or teams on the basis of national origin or identity, but criticizing any countries or their National Organizing Committees accused of perfidy is fair game.
 * You are in r/Olympics. Baron de Coubertin founded the Olympic movement in an effort to foster goodwill between nations. We expect you to embrace that, the Olympic spirit.
* **No Memes and no Low-Effort Posts**
 * However, .gif posts of video taken directly from Olympic events will be allowed on a case by case basis.  
 * If you post a standalone picture of an Olympian without any context or story, you have just submitted a low-effort post.
* **No Superfluous or Duplicate Posts**
 * When a prominent athlete does something memorable, there seems to be a rush of users gunning for a karma grab. It's fine if you want to start the discussion of the event, but once a conversation has been established and is gaining traction, please understand that there is limited room on the front page and avoid posting any superfluous or duplicate submissions, which will be removed anyway.
 * We do not want to discourage you from making a related post if your submission has a fresh take or a contrarian message. A ""related"" post is different from a ""duplicate"" post. Alternate views of an important moment, for example, are very welcome.
 * Ask yourself this if you are about to make a possible duplicate post: ""Do I have something new to say or show, or do I just want the sweet, sweet karma?""
* **No Nudity or Overt Sexualization**
 * For submissions specifically about the attractiveness of individual athletes, please visit our friends at /r/Ohlympics.
 * Wardrobe malfunctions are specifically excepted.
* **No Politics**
 * This includes discussion about geopolitics, international relations, and past civil wars.
 * We were overwhelmed by such subjects during Tokyo at the expense of people who wanted to talk about the games.
 * Anyone found engaging this behaviour will be banned until Paris. There will be no warnings and we will have a very short trigger.  We simply cannot and will not allow this to happen again.
 * Do not engage the trolls.  We will get rid of them as soon as we see them.
* **No Posts about Illegal Streaming**
 * If you promote an illegal streaming service or a VPN, you will be perma-banned.
* **No Posts about Television Coverage**
 * There will be a stickied post in which you can complain about your broadcaster and tell everyone how much better somebody else's is, but unless Savannah Guthrie narrates the Parade of Nations after asking Mike Tirico on-air how many quaaludes constitute an overdose, no individual posts complaining about your television network are otherwise allowed.
* **No Posts about Beijing as the Host City**
 * We recognise that many of you are troubled by the People's Republic of China hosting these games.  This is a fair point.
 * Please remember that the athletes had nothing to do with this.
* **No Posts about how the Medal Tally is Sorted**
 * Sports journalists In most countries sort the medal table by total golds, but the practise in the United States is to sort by total medals.  It has been this way for quite some time.  The IOC and the Associated Press take no position on the difference.  Quit bitching about it.
 * There will be a stickied thread where those of you who simply can't take it may vent freely.
 * Please remember that no country ""wins"" the Olympics: it is the athletes who win.

176,socialism,"Socialism, a community for socialists","An international community for socialists, to discuss current events in our world from our anti-capitalist perspective(s). Certain knowledge of socialism is expected from participants. This is not a space for non-socialists. Please be mindful of our rules before participating, as they are actively enforced.

New to socialism? Please visit r/Socialism_101 prior to participating here.","#Welcome to /r/Socialism


**Socialism as a political system** is defined by democratic and social control of the means of production by the workers for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit, based fundamentally on the abolition of private property relations.

**Socialism is also a sociopolitical movement** dedicated to the critique and dismantling of exploitative structures, including economic, gendered, ethnic oppression.

Socialism, as a movement, confronts these different systems of oppression as mutually conditioning, intersectional, and/or dialectically related within the current hegemonic order. It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided.

We look forward to your participation in our sub, but please be mindful of our posting guidelines. 

Are you new to socialist ideas? Wondering what alternatives to capitalism exist? Please check out our educational materials and wiki further down in this sidebar.

184,humor,Humor,For all things funny!,"*  **[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)**

Sit back in your finest leather chair, pop in your gold rimmed monocle, pour yourself a glass of top shelf brandy, and enjoy your stay here at **/r/humor**.

This is a place for funny things that require a little bit more thought and a longer attention span than over at **/r/funny** (which is where you should head once you've become raging drunk and switched over to beer). 

***

**What we want:**
 
* **Humorous/satirical videos of substance**. This can include videos of stand up comedy or comedy sketches. Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, you name it. Comedy of substance doesn't necessarily mean clean comedy... Just good comedy. 
* **Humorous/satirical articles of substance**. This can include articles from [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/), [Cracked](http://www.cracked.com/), and many other humor and satire-based websites along with funny real news stories. 
* **Your original content as long as it does not exceed 10% of your posts to Reddit**. Exceed that ratio, and our moderator neck beards will begin to furiously itch with anger...and you will be banned.
* **Use titles that describe what will be seen when the link is clicked.**  Posts with titles like ""This is the funniest thing I've ever seen."" or other editorialized titles will be removed.

***

**What we don't want:**

* Memes, Facebook, Tumblr, or Twitter.
* Self posted jokes.
* Videos of commercials.
* Images of text.
* One-off *funny* images.
* Link shorteners or redirectors, or ALL CAPS.
* Complaints in the comments. Downvote or report instead. 

***

**Other:**

* **Much of the best humor is mature and off-color, so many posts may be NSFW.**
* Post political humor and cartoons to **/r/politicalhumor**.
* Post comics to **/r/comics** or **/r/webcomics**.
* Posts are subject to minimum account age and karma requirements.

***

**Other subreddits of interest**:

* **/r/Funny** A treasure trove of funny images and screen shots, which is exactly what Al Gore created the internet for.
* **/r/Jokes** Jokes submitted by (and/or stolen by) your fellow Redditors.
* **/r/NotTheOnion** For stories so mind-blowingly ridiculous that you could have sworn it was an Onion article.

* **/r/NewsOfTheStupid** Real news stories about people doing really stupid things. A large percentage of the submissions are from the state of Florida.
* **/r/PoliticalHumor** A place where you can go to make fun of how stupid the other side's political opinions are, while at the same time reassuring yourself that all of your political opinions are completely infallible.

* **/r/Humour** That's not a misspelling; it's the subreddit dedicated to funny bits by our British brethren from across the pond. Feel free to play [Yakety Sax](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ) on repeat during your visit.

* **/r/FloridaMan** The World's Worst Superhero.

* **/r/DarwinAwards** Watch people stupidly remove themselves from the gene pool.

* **/r/ScenesFromAHat** A play-by-post version of the game from ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?""

* **/r/lol** A well-moderated place with Lots of Laughs. 

* **/r/MusicalComedy** Comedy that's musical.

* **/r/OneLiners** A variety of funny, one line jokes in a well-moderated, friendly community!

* **/r/Sarcasm** - Your everyday discussions, in a sarcastic fashion.

____________________________________________________
**Don't post your own work.** This sub is not for self promotion of any kind, and we prefer posts that are professional in nature. 
____________________________________________________

1. Links to articles in professional art publications are preferred. Please do not link to Facebook, Deviant Art, CNN/BBC or similar sites. Links to low quality content may be removed at the mods discretion.

2. Play nice. We expect a high level of discourse. Be thoughtful and compassionate.  If you have to make a choice between being right and being kind, please be kind. Insulting, trolling, flaming, derogatory or offensive comments may be removed. Users who do not abide by this rule may be banned. People will have dumb questions about art. This is ok.

3. Post that are primarily polemics, soapboxing, rants, short-form writing, or thinly veiled excuses to talk to yourself about the evils of post-modernism or whatever will be deleted at the mod's discretion. 

4. **No self promotion. Don't post your own artwork or projects.** Submissions should have to do with professionals working in dialogue with each other. 

5. Not a place for art requests or artwork ID. Calls for submissions, open calls and residency opportunities are allowed.  Post artwork identification requests to /r/WhatIsThisPainting/

6. No complaining about the rules.  The mods will consider thoughtful suggestions about the rules from long-time contributors of this subreddit, but relatively new users who insist on having in-depth discussions about why we're bad at moderating will be banned. Moderation is complicated, and mods don't have time or obligation to explain the intricacies to every new user.

* [Further explanation of our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/knives/wiki/rules/)

----

##Our Posting Policy: 

__Treat the other readers with courtesy and respect__ It is okay to offend people on r/knives, but it isn’t okay to put any effort into it. Posts and comments inciting violence, harassment or discrimination based on someone’s physical features, personal beliefs and place of birth/place of residency are not welcome here.   
    
* Be helpful, polite, and welcoming to knife newbies. Beginners are friends, not food.   

__Stay on topic__ You can post anything as long as it is related to knives: buying knives, collecting knives, sharpening tips, maintenance tips, how you use your knives, news related to the knife world in general, knife memes, etc… If there’s a knife in your post, feel free to post it.

__About ""NSFW"" content__ NSFW content is, for the most part, permitted on this sub as long as it’s not: gore, knife fights (and fights in general) or pornography of any kind.

__No selling__ It's OK to share the things you've made or a cool new product you've discovered, but this isn't the place to market products or web sites. Even the pros deserve to have a place where they can just hang out and be hobbyists again. It can be a fine line sometimes, but try to stay on the non-commercial side of it. YouTube links, amazon affiliate links and any online shop links are not allowed in here.

* Ads, promotions, product announcements, giveaways, AMAs, kickstarters, and links to self-owned businesses, facebook pages and blogs will usually be removed. _It's OK to promote a thing you love and the hobby you enjoy, but it's not OK to promote yourself or your business interest._    

* If you've made a knife and you're proud of it, post it. Do not post pricing or ordering information. 

* Links to self-owned youtube videos are allowed at moderator discretion; on-topic, sincere user content is welcome. Posts are more likely to be removed if they are originate from accounts used to frequently post self-owned links, or which cross the line into promotion of commercial products or of the channel itself. Product reviews, new product announcements, knifemaking videos, and anything beginning with ""This week's episode"" are especially unlikely to survive.

__Do not publish someone’s personal information without their consent__ Publish someone’s info without their consent and you might get banned.

__No illegal activities__ This includes any activities that could get you in trouble with local or international authorities.

##WELCOME TO /R/HOCKEYPLAYERS

**A place to learn about the great game of hockey. Share ways to improve your skills, hockey highlights, discuss the game, coaching resources and more.**

Please keep things geared towards playing (rather than watching) hockey. By this, we don't mean that hockey videos are banned. Rather, this means that content should focus on hockey played by our members rather than NHL/professional hockey. The exception to this is pro hockey content for the purpose of training or skill development of our members.

Discrimination based on race, sex, orientation, gender, etc. is not tolerated. Unfortunately, these problems still exist. Be part of the solution.

Be civil. Personal insults are not allowed here. 

Promotional posts are allowed to a reasonable extent, provided certain conditions are met:

* Honesty: Be open and honest about the fact that you are promoting your own channel, brand, product, etc. 
* Community: You should be engaging with the community as a whole – including other posts, not just your own. (Occasional exceptions to this may be granted for announcements and product promotions with significant value to our members.
* Frequency: Don’t overdo it. More than one post a week is probably too much.

We have a policy against low quality posts such as memes, shitposts, macros, 'MRW' etc.


If your post does not show up in the new section, please **[message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhockeyplayers)** the moderators.

**Got spray paint, a camera and something to say?**

What is Street Art:

Street Art can be a lot of things. Most commonly, people associate 'street art' with graffiti and vandalism. But really, it's any kind of art that can be seen from the street or in an urban setting. It can be a sicker, a stenciling, sidewalk chalk/painting, a mural on the side of a building, or even some public works.

&nbsp;

**To help us deal with the rise in spammers:**

* Submitting links to personal sites (in comments or as post) need to be offset by being an engaged member of the sub.  

* If you aren't having meaningful conversations outside your own threads, we will pull your self promotion posts.   

* Reddit requires a 10:1 ratio of posts vs. your own stuff.  [Read More](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)

* The above rules apply even if you aren't the ""owner"" of a site/channel/etc. If you're constantly making links to a site Ex: links to a buddy's or favorite tiny house co.

* If your post history shows you've posted identical/similar content in multiple subs, we'll be deleting it.  Common with people promoting their blogs or youtube videos.

&nbsp;

**Ban = break rules + do some of these:**

* You're not participating in the community
* You mainly post only in your own threads
* Post history shows duplicates in other subs
* Your account is new or low karma ( >100)
* Most links go to a certain site/company/etc

&nbsp;

**Note:** Bans aren't up for debate or discussion, it takes a lot to get banned, so they're permanent.  If you have concerns or questions, contact us before posting.  The best prevention is to be an awesome member of the community and contribute to conversations (mainly outside your own posts) and consider the optics of the links you post.  "

# A subreddit about photography techniques and styles.

****

####**[RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/about/rules/)**
#####(Hover for more info)
####Submissions should be:

###A **photograph** 

> - No paintings, illustrations, AI generated images, or screenshots. No heavily altered photographs or composites. No photos of other traditional art, where the subject will draw more attention than the capture approach.
> - As an exception, an all-black image may be posted in protest of the reddit API changes, as long as the title and comments are used to discuss the changes reddit announced.

###A photograph that **you** took 

> - You must be the author of the photos posted. Plagiarism is not tolerated and any suspicions should be [reported to the mod team directly.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fitookapicture&subject=Suspected%20plagiarism&message=Include%20a%20link%20to%20the%20submission%20in%20the%20message!)

###A **single** photograph 
> - Each post must consist of only one photo. No collages or albums are allowed as posts, but they can be shared in the comments.
> - Panoramas, panographs, stacked photos, and multi-exposures are allowed if you are the author of every photograph.

###A photograph that demonstrates an effort to teach/learn **technique** or **artistic style**, or which is being shared as an example of **quality photography**
> - No snapshots or low effort photographs. Your photo should be thoughtfully composed, have an obvious subject in proper focus, feature intentional use of color, tone, texture, lighting, and make purposeful use of depth of field.
> - Submitters must participate in the comments section and are expected to keep the conversation on topic to the photo. Posting a starter comment is a great way to demonstrate effort and interest in the discussion by describing your gear, settings, intention, and/or thought process.
> - Mundane photos of interesting subjects (views out of plane windows, sunsets, the moon, eye close-ups, pets, food, or similar) will be removed. Feature a novel photographic element, technique, or style to help them stand out from the rest of the photos of the same subject.

###All submission titles **must start with ""ITAP of""** and only describe the contents of the image
> - The title should accurately set expectations of the photo’s main subject with viewers. Titles must be a literal, concise, and objective description of the subject or scene without intention, reaction, interpretation, backstory, or lesser known names/acronyms. Do not use clever wording or phrases to draw extra attention to your photo.
> - Titles should not include equipment, process, social media info, clickbait, memes, emoji, hashtags, when the photo was taken, or references to any other posts. Any additional information should be added in a comment if you'd like to provide it.

###Portraits — **[Portrait]** tag
> - Photos of people, or where the image aims to capture the personality, essence, or classic beauty **are limited to Mondays (midnight to midnight - UTC timezone)** and must **include the [Portrait] tag in the title**. If you're uncertain, assume it's a portrait and only post on Monday.
> - Dynamic photos that depict people in action, in a unique setting or exceptional scene, or featuring unusual/atypical styling (such as hair or makeup), or photos that demonstrate distinctive photography techniques, are not considered portraiture under the rule described above. These types of photos are allowed to be posted throughout the week. Please refer to the Rules FAQ on the sidebar for examples.
> - Nudity and sexually suggestive content will be strictly regulated. Images that contain nudity or are considered NSFW but lack photographic techniques, or pictures that use nudity or sexuality as their key appealing element will be removed at the moderators' discretion. No advertising of third party NSFW websites is allowed.
> - Portrait submission titles **must include the [Portrait] tag.**

Portrait Monday is currently **not active**.  
Portrait Monday will begin in about 4 days, 14 hours.

###**No reposts**
> - A photo may be submitted to r/itookapicture only once.

###**Constructive criticism**
> - Constructive criticism is what this subreddit is here for. Structure your feedback on what you like about the photo, what you don’t like, how you would improve it. “Great Photo” may be a nice compliment, but it does nothing to help the submitter or other readers.
> - Don’t take offense to negative feedback. Understanding your mistakes and shortcomings is the best way to overcome them in future work.

###**Off-topic comments**
> - Off-topic comments unrelated to the photo will be removed.
> - Abusive language will result in a ban. This includes insults, swearing and sexual comments.

######**Posting Suggestions**

> - Use reddit's own upload feature or [imgur](http://imgur.com/) as they are RES friendly. Link directly to the image URL.
> - Avoid URL shorteners and personal blogs/websites if you want to skip reddit's spam filter.
> - If you want others to look at, vote and critique your photo, you need to make an effort to engage with commenters, answer questions and respond to criticism.

######**Additional Terms**

> - *By submitting your photos to /r/itookapicture, you are implicitly consenting to* ***allowing your photos to be submitted to our Instagram account*** *[(@itookapicture.art)](http://instagram.com/itookapicture.art). However, if at any time you do not wish to have your photo shared on IG,* ***you may opt out*** *by stating so, whether it is at the time it is posted on ITAP, by contacting the mods directly, or in the comments on either the Reddit or Instagram posts.*

2. If you criticize, make it constructive criticism.

5. No body shaming. This includes personal and general judgments about weight, surgeries, and appearance.

6. No trolling and no reposting of trolling and/or transphobic content. Trolling includes posts or comments meant to elicit controversy or drama.

7. Do not post information or photos of another person without their permission. Exercise caution when sharing personal information - this is a public subreddit.

8. Business advertisements are prohibited. We also are currently not accepting any research requests. Users selling items or relevant need at reasonable prices or users soliciting free/lost cost items may post in our monthly [Buy/Sell/Trade/Giveaway thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=flair%3Arecurring%20Buy%2FSell%2FTrade%2FGiveaway&restrict_sr=1) Users fundraising may post in our monthly [Fundraiser thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=flair%3Arecurring%20Fundraiser&restrict_sr=1)

*A trans meme subreddit for trans things!*

#**Also check out: /r/trans_irl**

#Rules

**1 - No off-topic content**  
Please ensure any posts you make relate to being trans/nonbinary/genderqueer/gender-non-conforming in some way.

**2 - Be nice to each other, no bigotry of any kind**  
Bigotry includes transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, ableism etc..  


**3 - Don't break sitewide rules**  
This is an obvious one, but we need to say it just in case. This includes posting uncensored screenshots of chats, or threatening violence against others.

**4 - Be amazing**  
Please don't say things which you wouldn't say to someone's face, or support ideas here which hurt factions of the trans community. Things like transmedicalism will be dealt with as transphobia.


**5 - Don't link to transphobia**  
Please don't link to transphobia (or other bigotry), even if your personal intent is to challenge the bigotry in some way. This is a meme sub. It's supposed to be fun.

**6 - NSFW content must be marked as such**  
If your post includes Not Safe For Work (over-18/sexual) content, mark it as NSFW. Posts must still be on-topic for the subreddit, i.e. no pornography (even if the explicit bits are cropped out) or sexual content for the sake of being sexual. Explicit post titles are not allowed. NSFW comments are only allowed on posts marked NSFW.

**7. No posts that invalidate other users' identities**
If your post will be exclusive for a certain gender please include the proper flair. Please ensure your post doesn't alienate other trans people. This includes:

* Testosterone-hating memes
* Assuming the gender of the reader
* Forced feminization memes

## **[RULES:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/wiki/rules)**

#*If you are visiting r/veterans for the first time please read the rules.*

#*We ban and do not look back. - this is your only warning* 

# Full explanation of the rules is found in the [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/wiki/rules)

1.  DON'T BE A DICK!

2.  Requesting money or services or linking to a page with a donation button or a charity or non-profit = BAN!
So don't do it. 

3.  No Linking/posting Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, or other Videos or Podcasts or Spotify or Gifs or anything of that nature!
When in doubt, [message the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FVeterans) before you post. 

4.  Financial Institutions:
Users representing financial institutions are not allowed to post, if you have questions about a VA home loan seek out a local trusted financial institution. Do not take advice from some unverified person on Reddit. They are not helping you out of kindness.

5.  Survey/Interview/Poll requests = BAN without pre-approval:
To prevent veterans personal information from being collected and used for malicious purposes, all posters must request permission [from the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FVeterans). 

6.  No Partisan Politics:
This includes White House Pensions and Change.Org petitions

7.  [No Promotion - yourself or others](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) = BAN!
If your username is the same as the link you are submitting you will be instantly banned. This is not the place to promote/advertise your or your friend's website, podcast, Discord server, business or to try to sell something. Do not post the names of Doctors or Lawyers or Real Estate/Mortgage personal or their email or phone numbers.

8.  Memes:
Have a talent to share? There is a sub for that, but this isn't it. Try /r/videos /r/Music /r/photography /r/IMadeThis /r/listentothis /r/videos. Memes includes anything meant to only entertain - no jokes, no funny pictures, no funny videos, etc. sorry but this is not the place for these

9.  No AMAs without pre-approval and verification:
You must be verified by the Moderators prior to posting AMA's.

10.  Moderators have final decision:
Only the Moderator's interpretation of the rules matters - your opinion of the meaning of the rules does not overrule any moderator decision. This is not a democracy and the rules are not open for debate or discussion. The rules are the rules. Your opinion is your opinion but that doesn't change the rules of this Subreddit. Moderators get final say in all rule questions and enforcement of those rules. 

11. You must use the actual title of the news article you are posting - posts incorrectly titled will be removed. If you have an opinion to express about the article, make a comment on the post. The title of your post is not the place to editorialize your opinion on that topic.

12. No Medical Advice - questions asking for Medical Advice or comments offering to provide medical advice will be removed

13. No Ban Evasion by creating a new account.

Per Reddit FAQ: Subreddit bans
A moderator can ban you from their subreddit for any reason at all. You'll receive an automatic message from the subreddit advising you of this ban. If the automatic message specifies a period for the ban (e.g. ""7 days""), this is a temporary ban which will automatically expire at the end of the period specified. If the automatic message does not specify a period for the ban, this is a permanent ban which will never expire.

When you are banned from a subreddit you can still read the subreddit and vote on its posts and comments, but you cannot submit posts or comments.

There is no Court of Appeals on Reddit for subreddit bans. Your only option is to send a message to the moderators of the subreddit you've been banned from, apologize for your actions, and politely request that the moderators reconsider your ban. The moderators have no obligation to remove your ban, to reconsider your ban or even to reply to your request."

### Rules

####Keep video highlights in appropriate threads. 
1. There will be daily discussion and highlight threads sticked to the front page every day by their respective bots. If you have a highlight you’d like to add that hasn’t been added already, please post to there. Relevant highlights are always welcome in match threads.

####Duplicate posts will be removed. 
1. Check the front page and recent submissions to be sure what you’re about to post hasn’t been done so already.

####Promotion must be kept within acceptable limits. 
1. We have strict rules for promoting content. When in doubt ask us for clarification before posting! Violation of these rules can result in a warning and/or ban on your account. As a rule of thumb, no more than 10% of your submissions may be to any single site or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content - you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no affiliation with.

####Do not editorialize titles. 
1. Please keep it so your title matches the headline of the article you’re posting or uses a quote to accurately depict the article.

####No content primarily for humor
1. Submissions and comments that do not spur discussions or inform users (news articles, etc.) will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) memes, funny screenshots, comics, etc.

####No personal attacks, witch-hunts, or inflammatory language
1. Whether against a reddit user or people in the sport, inciting harassment on any individual or group is not acceptable under any circumstances and will likely result in a ban. We understand that banter is a part of the sport, but please keep your tone civil.

2. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and other hatred-based commentary is prohibited. This includes using discrimination, slurs, and derogatory words with intent to offend and harm.

3. Ad-hominem attacks taking the place of civil discussion will be removed.

4. Witch-hunting, brigading, threatening, harassment, and targeting users is not allowed as per official Reddit guidelines. More information on that can be found [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully).

####English Language only please!
1. Because of the limits on our moderating team we ask that all submissions be in the English language. Thanks!

-
**[Observe Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**

New submissions will not appear until approved by a moderator.

**Wiki Guide:** [Tips On Writing a Successful Political Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/wiki/posts)


Please observe the following rules:

-
**1. Submissions should be an impartial discussion prompt + questions.**

* Keep it civil, no political name-calling.

* Do not ask [loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question) or [rhetorical questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question).

* No personal opinions/proposals or posts designed to support a certain conclusion. Either offer those as a comment or post them to r/PoliticalOpinions.

**2. Provide some background and context. Offer substantive avenues for discussion.**

* Avoid highly speculative posts, all scenarios should within the realm of reasonable possibility.

* Do not request users help you with an argument, educate you, or perform research for you.

* No posts that boil down to: DAE, ELI5, CMV, TIL, AskX, ""Thoughts?"", ""Discuss!"", or ""How does this affect the election?""

**3. Everything in the post should be directly related to a political issue.**

* No meta discussion about reddit, subreddits, or redditors.

* Potentially non-politics: Law, sociology, philosophy, celebrities, news, etc.

* We are not a link subreddit. Don't just post links to news, blogs, surveys, videos, etc.

**4. Formatting and housekeeping things:**

* The title should match the post. Don't use tags like `[Serious]`

* Check to make sure another recent post doesn't already cover that topic.

* Don't use all-caps. Format for readability: paragraphs, punctuation, and link containers.

There are very few rules in this subreddit:

1. Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). That means no name-calling and the rest of the stuff your mother told you to do once and then you promptly forgot. Just be nice, okay? We all make mistakes . . . including those who will be voting for this man.
2. Nearly anything goes. No one here will moderate this sub very closely, and therefore you are welcome to post both in support of the candidate and against him. Promote his views and ridicule him. Say what you want, pretty much, but be prepared to defend your voice.

3. If you are a mod of /r/conservative, fuck you. 


Yea . . . that's about it.

#Brief Bio of Ben

Ben Carson was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 18, 1951. His mother, though under-educated herself, pushed her sons to read and to believe in themselves. Carson went from being a poor student to receiving academic honors and eventually attending medical school. As a doctor, he became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital at age 33 and earned fame for his groundbreaking work separating conjoined twins. In 2015 he announced that he was running for the following year's presidential election, hoping to gain the Republican nomination. He ***WAS*** one of the party's leading candidates in the polls for a very short time, and now no one gives a rat's ass about him.

[New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

###About Us

**RULES**

1) **Not derp** Don't forget, though most Derps are incredibly r/aww, a lot of Awws aren't Derps. Pictures/gifs/videos should be easily discernible as ""Derpy"", and removals are up to mod discretion. Animals just existing, or not doing anything, or otherwise engaging in normal animal behaviour will be removed. Do not post images with superimposed text adding context for the ‘derp’ to be understood. Your post should be able to stand on its own without help from the title or additional text

2) **No compilations or memes** No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.  No memes or comics

3) **No NSFW** No NSFW content allowed. Posting NSFW content is grounds for being banned without warning. This includes comments, posts and title. Linking to NSFW subreddits is never allowed. Warning others that a post or comment is NSFW is not an excuse for violating this rule. Do not add the NSFW as clickbait, misuse of the the NSFW tag is prohibited

4) **No reposts** Reposts will be removed at mod discretion. Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban

5) **No derp injury** Do not post animals that are injured, suffering or appear to be uncomfortable

6) **No staged submissions** No staged submissions, no provoking animals to do something derpy or setting up a scene for an animal to do something cute or quirky. No photoshopped, AI generated images, or manipulated videos. No TikTok trends or challenges. A human playing with their pet is considered staged and not derp

Wiki: [/r/firearms wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/Firearms/wiki/index)

Until further notice, all posts pertaining to gun deals, sales, and of course the distribution of 3d printing files are prohibited. If you are interested in 3d printed firearms, just go to Google and type in exactly **Deterrence Dispensed** or **AWCY**.

Please come discuss what we can, because it may only be a matter of time before this and all firearms-related subreddits are removed from the site.

In this subreddit, we value Freedom of Speech as much as we value The Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Discourse is encouraged on this open-minded forum, and all firearms-related content moderation will be left to the mercy of the voting system.

We actively moderate all posts and comments that are either off-topic or violate the [Reddit Content Policy](
https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

Please be aware, when posting about state level bills and laws, tagging the post at the beginning with either the state or state abbreviation in brackets is best practice. Lack of tagging will assume national interest.

Next time you see an insane or hilarious US news story, consider posting it here so we can all have a good laugh, or just groan and roll our eyes.

This isn't about hating America or Americans, it's about mocking the elements of their society and culture which are incomprehensible to those of us who don't live there.

**Rules**

1. Try to keep it lighthearted - we're here for laughs, not hate. Remember, plenty of lovely Americans subscribe here for the lols.

1. If a post is NSFW, please mark it NSFW. Don't ruin someone's day.

1. No NSFL content, there are plenty of other subs for murder/death content.

1. No photoshops or obviously fake content. Lets keep this realistic. There are other subs for that.

1. Avoid re-posting submissions. Please check the top of all time and also search before submitting.

1. No image macros / memes.

1. No racism, bigotry or hate-speech. 

1. Don't be cunt. Please try to remain civil and avoid personal attacks on other users.

1. No serious political or election news. Post it in /r/politics. Posts mocking the farcical nature of US politics are fine.

1. Avoid editorialising headlines.

Certain fake news domains are blacklisted (rt.com, sputniknews.com, breitbart.com, foxnews.com). Posting links to those sites will result in automatic removal. 

If you have any suggestions for improving this subreddit, please let me know :)

A place for selachimorphaphiles to share discussion, experience, questions, photos, videos, research, original content, artwork, articles, and fashion. Pretty much anything relevant so long as it abides by our few rules. 

Sharks should be appreciated, understood, and respected. 
Not feared, disregarded, and poached to extinction.

## Shark Facts:

* Sharks belong to the class Chondrichthyes meaning they have skeletons made of cartilage. Contrary to popular myths **they do** get cancer.

* There are more than **470** species of sharks split across thirteen orders, including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct

* Fossil records indicate that ancestors of modern sharks existed over ~**420 million years ago**, making them older than *Dinosaurs!* *(~240 million years ago)*

* If you're incredibly lucky 1 in **11.5 million** are the odds of a shark attack, and 1 in **264.1 million** to die by a shark. In a lifetime, you are more likely to die from fireworks, lightning, drowning, a car accident, stroke, or heart disease.

* For every human killed by a shark, humans kill approximately **two million sharks.**

* No harassment ; no profanity, vulgar, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ablest or discriminatory language. 

* No advertising without approval by the mods. No private animal sales. If you need help rehoming we can suggest a rescue. 

* No Disrespectful comments.

* Only post photos and videos that belong to you.

* No crowdfunding links. 
501c3 rescues may post fundraising advertisements. 

* This is a CSC ( Chinchilla Specific Community ). All posts involving chinchillas interacting with other pets will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. We do not support nor do we wish to promote possibly dangerous acts. 

* Posts containing dangerous items/acts/foods are subject to discussion or removal. 

* Failure to follow these simple rules will result in a ban without warning. Our goal is to keep this forum as knowledgeable and usable as possible. You CAN be unbanned at a later time by sending a message to the Mods. Depending on what is said or done it can result in a permanent ban. Temporary and immediate bans are at our discretion. **

* We will not tolerate Back Yard Breeding.   ""Backyard breeders, people who breed their pet store chins, and ""oops"" litters generally cater to popular colors or the general cuteness that all babies offer. This indiscriminate breeding leads to weaker bodies with chins prone to malocclusion, heart murmurs, genetically predisposed behavior problems, fur chewing and overall questionable health. However, even these animals need good, loving homes. Be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem. Save lives: Leave the breeding to the professionals.""

* Those who are back yard breeding or are suspected to be back yard breeding will be removed.

**The Pentagon Reddit**

**The Pentagon** - the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, located in Arlington County, Virginia. As a symbol of the U.S. military, ""the Pentagon"" is often used metonymically to refer to the U.S. Department of Defense.

The Pentagon was designed by American architect George Bergstrom (1876–1955), and built by general contractor John McShain of Philadelphia. Ground was broken for construction on September 11, 1941, and the building was dedicated on January 15, 1943. General Brehon Somervell provided the major motive power behind the project; Colonel Leslie Groves was responsible for overseeing the project for the U.S. Army.

The Pentagon is a large office building, with about 6,500,000 sq ft (600,000 m2), of which 3,700,000 sq ft (340,000 m2) are used as offices. Approximately 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel work in the Pentagon. It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, and five ring corridors per floor with a total of 17.5 mi (28.2 km) of corridors. The Pentagon includes a five-acre (20,000 m2) central plaza, which is shaped like a pentagon and informally known as ""ground zero,"" a nickname originating during the Cold War on the presumption that it would be targeted by the Soviet Union at the outbreak of nuclear war.

On September 11, 2001, exactly 60 years after the building's construction began, American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked and flown into the Western side of the building, killing 189 people including the five hijackers. It was the first significant foreign attack on the capital's governmental facilities since the burning of Washington during the War of 1812.

Content Philosophy

Content which benefits the **community** (news, rumors, and discussions) is valued over content which benefits only the **individual** (technical questions, help buying/selling, rants, etc.).  This fundamental difference in audience is why we support two communities, [r/Apple](/r/apple) and [r/AppleHelp](/r/applehelp).

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).
* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.

> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.

> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )

/r/secretsanta and Reddit Gifts were started in 2009 to provide a Secret Santa exchange for the Reddit community. On January 24, 2022, Redditgifts was officially closed and we are no longer running exchanges.  You can read more about this decision in the announcement post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/nw294q/sunsetting_secret_santa_and_reddit_gifts/). LONG LIVE REDDITGIFTS!  

# Rules

Posts which include the following will be removed to the mods discretion:
 
1. Posted by throwaways, alt accounts or on behalf of another user as we cannot investigate the issue at hand.
2. Complaints about gifts, Santas, or giftees. This should go through [official channels](https://www.redditgifts.com/info) rather than public shaming.
4. Asking for one-on-one exchanges outside of redditgifts.
5. Offering to send a gift to someone who wasn't matched or who didn't get a gift.
6. ""Gift spoilers."" Let your giftee see their gift for the first time when open the box, not on /r/SecretSanta.
7.  We are a meme-free subreddit.
8.  No karma whoring.
9. This is one of the nicest places on the Internet, so we expect participants to be polite and civil to one another. 

## Self promotion

Despite the [closure of the marketplace](http://redd.it/2xdkyi) and Redditgifts, we continue to disallow self-promotion in /r/SecretSanta.

**Note:** You can post own experiences in the *new* weekly stickied or pinned share-your-experience thread.

When r/Bitcoin moderators began censoring content and banning users they disagreed with, r/btc became a community for free and open crypto discussion. This happened long before the creation of Bitcoin Cash. 

Over the years /r/btc became community of historians & torchbearers, preservers of Satoshi's Bitcoin for future generations. In this place you can learn what ""Bitcoin"" means and what it truly represents. 

Bitcoin is the *currency of the Internet*. A distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever.

There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, *you can be your own bank*. [Read the original Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto.](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)

We welcome free and open Bitcoin-related discussion, Bitcoin news, and exclusive AMA (Ask Me Anything) interviews from top Bitcoin and cryptocurrency leaders. This subreddit was created to uphold and honor free speech and the spirit of Bitcoin; [learn more about us](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index).

281,economy,Economy,"Forum for economy, business, politics, stocks, bonds, product releases, IPOs, advice, news, investment, videos, predictions, government, money, politics, debate, capitalism, current trends, and more.","#Economy

Like a free market, this subreddit is mostly unregulated.  If you can bond it to the economy, then we will trade it.

**Topics of Interest**

* Market and Economy News
* Business Earnings and Releases
* Investor and Trader Tips 
* News that Moves the Markets 
* Long Term and Short Term Investment Ideas
* Economic Related Humor
* Most Anything Related to the Economy
* And, most *EVERYTHING* is Related to the Economy

**Please Do Not**

* Report a submission just because you don't like it. The report function is only for spam. Spam = actual spam. example: ""I made $67,053 on google last week. Click here to find out how!""

* Again, 'spam' is not an article you don't like. Spam is a sleazy advertising gimmick or a phishing attempt. Stop wasting our time with fake spam reports.

* Rant about articles you haven't bothered to read. If you come in and say something like ""I didn't read this, but it's crap!"" that indicates you probably don't know what you're talking about. Therefore you may receive a warning or a ban. If you want to rant about articles you haven't read, go do that at r/worldnews or r/news.

**Please Do**

* Be friendly.
* Be interesting.
* Be bold.

***
RULES

Please do not post duplicates. They will be removed on sight.

Attempting to derail discussion and/or discredit another user by calling them a 'bot', 'shill', troll', etc.; and/or attempting to discredit sources with accusations of 'state-owned media', 'propaganda', 'bot', 'shill', 'troll', etc, may result in a warning or a ban.

Material about the stock market and government statistics is usually time-sensitive. The value of such material declines as it ages. So don't post old material about the stock market and economic data. Stuff older than 2 weeks or so will be removed at our discretion. On the other hand, an academic paper from 2 years ago (as an example) might still be relevant so will not be removed.

Editorializing a headline is allowed. However, intentionally misleading editorialized headlines that say the opposite of what the article says, are not allowed.

No political advertising. No PAC campaign material

Posting AI-generated images and passing them off as real, without including a disclaimer that the material was created by AI is not allowed in this sub. Posting AI-generated articles written by ChatGPT or any other AI application, without including a disclaimer that the material was created by AI is also not allowed in this sub. Exceptions will be made for satire. Violations may result in a warning or a ban.

294,reactiongifs,Reaction GIFS: Your absurd responses to everything.,"Give a man a gif and he will meme all day, teach a man to REACT and he will be as a GOD","######

###Reaction?

A reaction gif is a physical or emotional response that is captured in an animated gif **which you can link in response to someone or something on the Internet.** The reaction must not be in response to something that happens within the gif, or it is considered a ""scene."" For example:  
  
* [Scene.](http://i.imgur.com/eFlYEsc.gifv)  
* [Reaction 1.](http://i.imgur.com/3ODbnTM.gifv)  
* [Reaction 2.](http://i.imgur.com/vOOMz3F.gifv)

######

###Rules

1. Your gif must actually contain some sort of reaction. Your submission title has no bearing on whether the gif you submit is a reaction gif or not. Non-reactions and analogies will be removed.
2. Upvote, downvote, inbox and reddit gold gifs are not allowed and will be removed. Please direct your submission to /r/upvotegifs or /r/goldgifs.
3. If you submit a gif that is submitted often or was submitted recently, it may be removed. If you're reusing a gif, try to come up with an original title—a new angle.
4. Please direct your cake day posts to /r/cakeday.  Cakeday posts are not allowed in any form.
5. Individual gifs only and link directly to the gif. A direct link ends in one of the following: .JPG .JPEG .PNG .GIF .GIFV .MP4 .WEBM
6. No gore or porn/nudity.
7. You must use an appropriate host listed below for your gif.
8. Let me make this clear: If you make [OC] and you want [OC] Flair, you gonna have to tag that shit [OC] in the title, capisce?
9. The rules are the rules.  Deal with it like an adult.  Don't mention or complain about rules or mod teams of any subreddit.
10. Keep comments civil.   Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, etc is not tolerated and will result in a ban, even if you think you are just joking.
11. No spoilers.  Do not post spoilers for current media. Use spoiler tags when discussing any recent shows or movies.
12. Do not engage in witch hunts or brigades. reddit is not your personal army.
13. We do not allow participation of users from hatereddits that ban due to actions in other subreddits.

1) Don't be a jerk. Please follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

2) Posts relating to the 2016 elections are strongly encouraged. Editorialized links and other opinion pieces are fine, but try to not use sensationalized titles. 

3) Posts related to the 114th Congress, statewide elections, and other important developments relating to potential candidates are also okay. If you want to post something but you aren't sure if it's relevant, post it anyway and we can decide if it should stay or be moved to a different sub. If a submission leads to some sort of meaningful discussion, it is *very* unlikely to be removed.

4) Feel free to speculate and make predictions, but try to back up those predictions with sources.

5) It's okay to post 100% in support of a specific candidate. If you want a diversity of views in this subreddit, contribute and vote accordingly. This is a place for everything having to do with the election.

6) No advertising *without permission*. That includes for products, candidates, blogs, businesses, or subreddits. Please ask the mods for permission.

7) Do not change the title of an article to include your opinion. Writing an editorial text post that includes the article as the main focus is also silly - if you want to discuss an article, submit the article as a link-post and include your opinions in a comment.

This is the place to be when you want to discuss anything related to ecology! 

**If your submission is not related to ecological science or if it's not predominantly in English, expect it to be removed. In particular, environmental activism submissions belong in /r/environment or somewhere else.** 

Your post will probably be removed by the moderators if:

- Is a /r/HomeworkHelp style question. If you are not a student then please state explicitly why you are asking the question

- is a climate change post that is not focussed on one or more species. There are already numerous CC subreddits (that you can find in our sidebar), and also this sub would quickly get drowned out by this sort of content.

- Your title does not adequately describe the content

- Is a fundraising campaign/effort

- Is a petition

- Is a low effort image macro/meme post

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be ""Oniony"". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

304,vegetarian,Vegetarian,"Welcome to r/vegetarian, the community for anyone interested in a vegetarian diet. Being a vegetarian isn't required to participate, but please respect that most of us are, by staying on topic and avoiding encouragement of non-vegetarian food. We are mostly US-based & follow the understanding that vegetarianism could include dairy and/or eggs. Please read the rules & learn about Reddiquette before posting.","##Full Rules **[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/wiki/rules/)**
_______________________________________

#**Rules of Veggit**

**1. Be Civil and Follow Reddiquette**

Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and remember the human behind the screen. This means don’t be a jerk, no trolling, bullying, name-calling, hostility, badgering or mocking individuals or vegetarians as a group. People who violate this rule will be permanently banned. Users who harass other users or moderators will be reported to Reddit’s Admins.    
 
**2. Vegetarian Requirement** 

Posts and comments must be directly related to the vegetarian (human) diet (i.e., food). The connection must be clear, relevant and directly specific to a vegetarian diet. Evangelism, proselytizing and/or derailing discussions by arguing against vegetarianism is not welcome here. If you would like to discuss the ethical implications of the various vegetarian diets, egg/dairy industries, pet ownership, fashion, etc., please create a thread on the general subreddit r/vegetarianism instead.

**3. Respect Other People’s Choices** 

If your only contribution to a discussion is to derail it, berate other users, and/or push or encourage a lifestyle or diet without provocation, the moderators will take action. Users who violate these policies will be warned or banned. This includes evangelism, proselytizing, or any other activism with the intent of converting users to another diet or lifestyle.  

**4. Vote Manipulation & Cross-Posting**

Reddit prohibits brigading & vote manipulation, which applies when a call to action is made either directly or implied. This applies either to or from /r/vegetarian. If a post is suspected of such activity, it will be locked, removed & reported to the Reddit admins. Users who violate this policy will be permanently banned. Cross-posts to and from the subreddit must be formatted using a non-participation link: 
http://np.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/

**5. Recipes Requirement**

To ensure all meals posted are actually vegetarian, complete recipes & clear titles are required. Photos must present the dish in an appetizing way (i.e., in clean surroundings, not in your lap, on a plate or in a bowl, not half eaten, in good lighting, properly focused, etc.). [More info](https://new.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/wiki/how_to_post_a_recipe). Low effort/overly simplistic dishes which don't need a recipe (i.e., raw fruits & vegetables or dishes made entirely from store-bought ingredients) will be removed.

**6. Vegetarian Grocery Items & Faux Meats**

New info about vegetarian products or faux meats being available at grocery stores/restaurants should be given the ‘News’ flair. If you'd like to share a product you tried, please use the ‘Product Endorsement’ flair & include **the product name & the name of the store where you purchased it in the title**. Per Rule 5, if you use a faux meat, it can't be the main component & must meet the requirements (i.e., homemade spaghetti & meatballs is fine, store bought sauce with Beyond meatballs is not).

**7. Restaurant Meals** 

If you would like to share an experience you had in a restaurant, please use the ‘Travel’ flair and include a good quality photo of the dish prior to being eaten. **Add the name and location of the eatery.** As with Rule 6, we do not want to be a free advertising channel for big corporations & fast food chains, so pictures of faux meats from chains using Impossible, Beyond, Gardein, Linda McCartney etc., will be removed at moderator discretion. [More info](https://new.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/wiki/how_to_post_a_recipe).

**8. Common Questions** 

If you’re a beginner, please read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/ej3isn/happy_2020_if_you_are_new_to_vegetarianism_please/). If you are new to this subreddit, please consider that your question may have been asked before & perform a basic search before asking your question. Please read our wiki & FAQs before posting. Moderators will remove vague and open-ended or general requests for recipes, advice or meal suggestions.

**9. Food Restrictions Beyond a Vegetarian / Vegan Diet**
If you have specific foods that you are unable to eat for reasons beyond a vegetarian or vegan diet, there are better resources than this subreddit. If due to a medical condition, please seek help from a healthcare provider or post on /r/AskDocs. If due to reasons other than medical, help can be found on /r/PickyEaters and /r/EDAnonymous."

####Welcome to /r/EarthPorn, reddit's premiere landscape photography subreddit. 

[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

######Please post your own images here, but before you do, kindly read and adhere to the following rules:

###### **Rules:**
Submissions must be:

###### A photograph.
No Paintings, illustrations, gifs, videos, or interactive images.

###### A photograph you took (OC) 
or one which you can provide the [original source for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_this_is_my_first_time_submitting.2C_what_should_i_know.3F) Do not rehost non-OC images to reddit or imgur. Failure to provide the photographers name or the original source of the image can result in a ban. 

###### A single image
Albums may be posted in the comments.
Panoramas, Image Stacks, Composites, and images edited via Photoshop or similar software are allowed.

###### An image featuring a natural landscape
Images must have visible land. Images with humans, machines, boats, roads, airplanes, farms, animals, buildings, or other human-made objects in them [will be removed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_what_types_of_images_are_allowed.3F)

###### An unsilhouetted image
Images where details in the landscape are not visible due to silhouetting will be removed.

###### No photos taken illegally
This includes flying your drone in a no-fly zone. Please respect local laws and access closures!


###### **Title Requirements:**
You submission title must contain the following:

###### The location of the area in the photo.
When it comes to location, the more specific the better. If you wish to not disclose the location you should at the very least name the state/country. Rule of thumb for naming only the location (e.g. a lake, mountain): if one can find the place immediately by searching it in google it's fine. For possibly ambiguous locations add state/country for safety.

###### The resolution of the image in pixel format.
For example, an image taken on an iPhone 6 would have a resolution of [3264x2448]

###### The photographers name.
If you took the photo use [OC]. OC submitters will be reward with different camera flairs based on number of OC submissions.

###### Do not include your device name in the title.
Feel free to add photography details such as camera, lens, and settings, as a comment.

###### Do not ask for upvotes in your title.
A complete list of subreddit rules are found in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index)

---

###### **Comment Rules:**

Hate Speech, Abusive remarks, homophobia, and the like have no place on this subreddit, and will be removed on sight.

Please contribute to the discussion positively; constructive criticism is fine, but if you don't like a picture and you wish to voice your opinion please refrain from abusing the photographer/submitter.

---

###### **Other important rules:**

EarthPorn is not a catch-all subreddit. Images that are submitted here are individually reviewed for compliance with our subreddit rules. If your submission is removed, a moderator should advise which of our network of SFWPorn subreddits would be a more appropriate place to submit.

* Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to ""fix"" the colors of an image or remove a watermark.
* Non-OC submissions are restricted to [one per day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2pd9kj/a_small_rule_change_for_earthporn/)**
* Regarding reposts: [Submissions are considered reposts if they have been submitted in the last 2 years or if they have received more than 20,000 karma when they were previously submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/rkyp98/rules_update_for_2022/) 
* Circlejerky/sandbagging/pandering titles may be removed.
* If you have any questions check out the [**wiki**](/r/EarthPorn/wiki/).
* Breaking multiple rules will result in a ban.

**Rules**

No advertising or marketing.  If you wish to advertise on this website, use the official channel [here](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising).  Promotions that involve product advertising are also prohibited.  **Organic product recommendations with links to products on sales sites are allowed.** However, we've been doing this a long time, and you will likely be banned if you try to represent your advertising as an organic product recommendation.  We do not recommend testing our ability to discern the difference, unfortunately we've had a lot of practice.  **If you try to subversively advertise we will not only ban you from r/shiba and r/shibainu, we often work with the website admins to to ban these users from reddit in its entirety.**

To post or enjoy **shibe memes** visit /r/shibe or one of the other related shibe subreddits.  **Meme-coin related submissions and comments in the shiba subreddits will result in a removal of posting privileges.**  Shibe memes and meme comments on /r/shiba will be removed, although referring to your shiba as shibe or doge as a term of endearment is fine.  In the same vein, meme related *titles* for your posts *are* allowed, but the content must adhere to the subreddit rules.  

Posting third-party content is okay, but **please do not post third-party content more than once per month.**  This is subject to moderator discretion, to ensure the organic nature of the subreddit.

Our community is the highest importance, no user is worth more than our community.  **Behavior detrimental to our community will be removed, and may result in a permanent removal of that user.**

**Backyard breeders will likely be banned, regardless of the intent for sale or not for sale.**  If you are not a reputable breeder do not post content about breeding your dogs here.  Use the following page as a guideline: https://www.shibas.org/breeders.html

If you feel you meet that standard, we recommend messaging the moderators for approval before posting.

**Shiba FAQ**

1) **Why is my shiba really itchy?** For previous discussion on this topic, checkout [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shiba/comments/2vmv3i/4_month_old_is_itching_throughout_the_day_any/) or [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shiba/comments/2w07qz/shiba_itches_constantly/).

2) **How do I find a reputable Shiba breeder?** The [National Shiba Club of America](http://www.shibas.org/breeders.html) maintains a listing of reputable Shiba breeders across the US. If you love dogs, please do not buy from a puppy mill or a backyard breeder. 

3) **My shiba doesn't seem to eat when I put food out, are they okay?**  While loss of appetite can be indicative of a problem, some shibas like to nibble throughout the day instead of eating in one sitting.  If you have this type of shiba, leave food out at all times, they will eat when they want.  However, monitor their weight and adjust accordingly if they begin to eat too much.  This behavior is also common when shibas are in a new environment or separated from their primary caretaker(s).

4) **My shiba spends a lot of time licking/grooming themselves, is this normal?**  While over-grooming may be indicative of allergies or other skin problems, shibas can spend a lot of time cleaning and manicuring themselves.  This behavior is normal.  Neurotic licking and biting to the point of hair-loss or scabbing is *not* normal and should be referred to a veterinarian.

5) **Why does my shiba take a long time to defecate on walks?**  Shibas often will not ""go"" near their home.  The farther they are from home, the more likely they will.  Sometimes they will have a common area that's used with frequency, once you've identified that area take them there.

6) **If you're the caretaker of a new shiba and you're looking for advice, please use the search feature.**  These questions are asked frequently, there is a wealth of information going back many years.  You will receive the greatest amount of advice with a simple search.  Feel free to ask anyway, but historically these questions are ignored by the majority of our community due to their frequency.

7) **My shiba seems sick and/or their health seems different, what should I do?**  Veterinarians spend *many* years of their lives training to become experts so they can help in these situations - go see one!  Even if a vet did respond, without seeing the dog in person a diagnosis will be lacking at best.  This community is not meant for medical advice, any advice you receive is likely going to be poor, misleading, or blatantly wrong.

8) **I would like socialize and train my shiba, where can I learn?**  Visit /r/Dogtraining, they can get you started, give you tips for specific behaviors, and recommend other sources to develop these skills.

* Meta posts discussing the subreddit itself are allowed but are subject to Mod discretion.

338,Alabama,Alabama,,"#General
Thanks for visiting!

Please read the rules below before contributing.
If you have any questions or your post gets caught in the spam filter--please feel free to message the mods.

#Political Posts
Political posts and discussions are allowed here, but /r/Alabama is non-partisan. Personal attacks, lies, smears, and ugliness is over the line; the post or comment may be removed, and if there's continuing transgressions, banning may result.

Consider instead /r/AlabamaPolitics, which is specifically set up for the hurl and burl of Alabama politics. Cross-posts to, or from, there are welcome.

#Power Outages
To see power outage status updates, please check out Alabama Power Outage Information [here](https://poweroutage.us/area/state/alabama).

#Rules
1. **Be respectful.** Please refrain from personal attacks and posting anything racist (this includes images) or prejudicial (incest jokes are old and unfunny). 

2. All submissions should be directly related to Alabama.

3. Blanket insults and attacks on Alabama and its citizens based on stereotypes and caricatures is not allowed. This does not preclude criticism--even fierce criticism--of the state, its people, and its policies; only that which is blatantly insulting and caricatures the state in an effort to gin up outrage and lulz.

4. Not Safe For Work content is not allowed on r/alabama. This includes graphic images or descriptions of violence, sexual content, and nudity. Exceptions include: images/videos of an Alabama disaster, like tornado footage; and newsworthy footage/images of violence that are marked NSFW and censored if possible. 

5. Limit re-posting. Posting differing views of a topic is fine. If a submission is too similar to another existing thread, it may be removed. Those types of posts should be made as comments to the existing thread.

6. Direct solicitation is not allowed. This includes political solicitation (donate to my campaign!) and economic solicitation (come to my restaurant for 50% off!). Exceptions include information about a local event like a music festival, personal blogs that do not solicit products or services, and advertisement of petitions for Alabama-specific issues.

7. Editorializing linked post titles is not allowed. When linking to articles from outside reddit, try to keep post titles as close as possible to the original source. Adding detail or context is allowed, as long as it does not fundamental change the original title or adds opinion or commentary not intended by the author. Do not post links to articles as a text post without additional commentary or context.

8. No false or misleading information. Categorically false or misleading information is not allowed. This is not to limit discussion on things that may be uncertain, but rather to prevent the propagation of demonstrably untrue information from bad-faith actors.

Be sure to read the Community Standards and Submissions Scope.","A place for news and discussion about politics in the Golden State, with more politics than r/Golden_State and more r/California than /r/politics. Be sure to read the [Community Standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/california_politics/wiki/rules) and Submissions Scope.

### 1. Civility  

No Racism, sexism, ageism, and other forms of bigotry. No hate speech, slurs, overly obscene, pejorative name-calling, vulgar, or abusive language. This includes usernames, and violations of this this will result in an automatic ban. Our commitment to civil discourse is one of the core principles, and we do not make any exceptions from this rule.

### 2. Topical  

Content must be explicitly related to Californian politics. This includes the interaction of federal and state politics, as well as the state's congressional delegation. Local politics are permissible if they would reasonably be of interest to a statewide audience. The subject of discussion on is never the conduct or motives of another user but is always about the substance of what people are saying.

### 3. Sourced  

Statements of fact should be clearly associated with a supporting source. Stating it is your opinion that something is true does not absolve the necessity of sourcing that claim. If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up by linking to a supporting, qualified source and quoting the relevant section. There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

### 4. Respectful  

Please leave out any content which are intentionally disparaging to individuals, groups of people, or could be construed to be effectively an insult to an entire class of people. Any language which a reasonable observer would conclude disparages another user in any way is considered a violation of this rule. Demeaning language, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

### 5. Specific  

Name the specific individual or the specific group who said, or did, the thing. No lay speculation about groups of people such as ""people on the left/democrats/the media"". If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it. 

### 6. Quality

A submission should not consist only of a joke, a humorous remark, or a flippant comment. You can certainly include humor as part of a full and comprehensive post, but your post should not be made solely for the purpose of being funny. This especially includes low quality snide comments. We do not allow naked expressions of opinion, low effort comments, sarcasm, jokes, memes, off-topic replies, or comments about source quality.

### 7. Enforcement

Comments that break the [Subreddit Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/california_politics/wiki/rules) should be reported, and shall not be replied to. Replying with a rule violating comment of your own will just get both of them removed and makes that much more work for the mod team. Comments in reply to rule violations may also be removed in order to encourage reporting of violations, rather than participation in said violations. 

### 8. Knowledge  

Users are expected to have already read and understand the rules before contributing.

**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, or a photo essay, of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.","**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, video, or photo essay of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.     

**PLEASE READ OUR SEVEN QUICK RULES:**

1: Photos and videos must be over 25 years old. 

2: Please put the year or decade in title, otherwise your post will be removed. 

3: Spam, racist, homophobic, sexist and offensive comments, as well as brigading, consistent reposting and shitposting, will result in a lifetime ban. Offensive comments include anything about pimping, about people's moms and scoring women. Nobody cares about your sexual impulses, least of all the OP.

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed. 

6: All posts must feature a person.  

7: We reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't showcase historical coolness. This includes photos, which are not obviously retro and portraits of famous young women doing nothing but posing.

#### [](#h4-green)  
> **Posting Rules**
---
 ---
*Remember: the rules change on weekends! See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*
 ---
1. **No Black Market Sourcing:** Do not offer, or ask for, recommendations on: where or how, on the black market, to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, seeds, THC, CBD, etc.) freely exchanged or otherwise; or on how to smuggle, transport, ship, mail, or otherwise travel with cannabis or its derivatives. Do not make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics.
2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.
3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You might be interested in /r/saplings instead, where Redditors under 18 can ask questions about cannabis and its effects.
4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posts promoting specific products or name brands, promoting YouTube channels or other forms of Social Media, and linking to online stores or other places designed to make money. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).   Learn more about [spam](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) on Reddit.
5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, screenshots, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts  about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.
6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. 
7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).
8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  
10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the ""Monday Mourning"" thread each week.

The /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.

---
#### [](#h4-green)  
> **The /r/Trees Weekend**
---
 ---
####SLACK-POST SATURDAY
 ---
* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).
> 
---
####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

##Rules:

1.  **Mods = Gods**  
Do NOT break any rules that the mods might invent on the spot.  

2. **4chan Only**  
Do NOT post anything unrelated to 4chan. Do NOT link directly to 4chan.org. Do NOT post anything from unrelated websites. Screencaps from 4chan are ideal.  

3. **New Content Only**  
Do NOT post screencaps over a year old, do NOT repost, and do NOT omit the date and time stamp. Those posts belong in /r/classic4chan (RIP).

4. **High Quality Only**  
This applies to quality content and quality presentation. Crop your post so it's actually legible. Don't post garbage that isn't entertaining.  

5. **No Redditry**  
Do NOT act like a basic reddit bitch. This includes cliche reddit phrases, subreddit mentions, puns, song lyrics, novelty accounts, getting lots of karma on a single post, sperging out at someone like a 13 year old on Xbox, and other dummy things that make you a manchild.  
E.g. not my proudest fap, /r/theydidthemath, I did nazi that coming, cake day, Fake and Gay, /u/[somethingstupid], 1000 upvotes, etc.  

6. **No Doxxing**  
Do NOT reveal personal information, or post 4chan screenshots that contain personal information of any individual. Do not post 4chan screenshots of Reddit account names or calls for raids. Remember, NYPA.  

7. **No CP**  
Do not post nude images of underage children, or say that nude images of underage children aren't child pornography, or say that nude images of underage children are okay, or describe images of underage children in text form.  
If we see you do this anywhere on Reddit, we will report you to the law enforcement agency of where you live.

8. **NSFW marking**  
Do NOT forget to mark NSFW content. The overall subreddit is SFW, so people need to really know when a submission is legit NSFW. (Potty Words are not NSFW).  

9. **No Grooming**  
No agendaposting.

10. **Admin abuse**  
The admins bypassed the mods and directly took action on the subreddit.

360,startups,The community for ventures designed to scale rapidly | Read our rules before posting ❤️,"Welcome to /r/startups, the place to discuss startup problems and solutions. Startups are companies that are designed to grow and scale rapidly.  Be sure to read and follow all of our rules--we have specific places for common content and requests.","*****

#Wiki
[FAQs, lessons, and resources](/r/startups/wiki/)
  
-----

#About  
Welcome to r/startups, a community for all backgrounds, levels of expertise, and business experience. 
####What is a startup?
Startups are designed to scale/grow rapidly. Startups utilize tech to do this. Startups can be non-tech companies that utilize tech. Startups are information era companies and they are creating the new best practices in business.  

####/r/startups 

We share interesting discussions and stories about our startup journeys, both the failures, the successes, and the embarrassments. **Our best traits are authenticity and integrity.**

-----

#Ask Someone Anything!
### We want to know who you want to ask anything!
Tell us who you want to interview in that thread.



---

#Flair
[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fstartups&subject=Flair+please) for instructions on how to get flair verifying your experience. 

----

#Rules

#####1.Relevant Content Only

We are a community of discussion based around startups, not traditional businesses.

All content must be relevant to startups.

You are welcome to ask how to apply startup methodologies to your traditional business if you frame your question in a non-promotional way. We want you to be able to ask any question that helps your startup.


#####2.No direct sales, advertisements, or promotion

**No direct sales, advertisements, or promotional posts of any kind**. We have designated places that are an exception to this rule and they will always be stickied at the top of /r/startups.

* You MAY share your startup in the Monthly Share Your Startup thread

Self-promotion is anything you have an interest, stake or relationship with including being friends with someone at the company.

At the end of the day, /r/startups moderators have the final say if your comments are promotional or not.

#####3.Submissions Serve a Specific Purpose

Submissions are for discussing methodologies, experiences, tactics, strategies, techniques, markets, and other such things WITHOUT tying them directly to your own project using its name or URL.

Titles must be clear and descriptive.

Submissions must have at least 250 characters of content. The more details you provide us the better support our community can provide you with. Life life, the more you put into something the more you get out of it.

#####4.Feedback Has a Place

All Feedback Requests (including surveys/polls) belong in our [Feedback Thread or other appropriate weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/boq669/your_weekly_threads_guide_learn_about_the_new/)

You are invited to repost each week. 

Be sure to contribute to the others in the thread and ask them to return the favor to increase engagement.

You may not publicly offer feedback or direct support outside of the Stickied Threads.


#####5.Rules for Links in Comments/Discussions

Sometimes you think the best solution is simply to link to a resource that might answer someone's question. We want you to be able to link in discussion to relevant content. We also don't want the discussion to turn into a self promotional mess and link farm.

If you are going to link to something in the comments please make sure to:

* Write at least a sentence explaining why the link is relevant to the discussion.

* Link only content you have no affiliation with. Affiliate links = banned.

#####6.Do Not Solicit PM Requests

The purpose of making a submission or comment is to engage in a public discussion with the community. 

It is not to request a PM/DM from someone. 

You are more than welcome to engage privately with one another, but it is up to you to take the initiative directly.


#####7.Sharing Your Blog is To Start a Discussion

Sharing your blog is not a means to self promote.

A link to the original blog post is allowed with **prior** Mod approval.

If you are submitting your own blog content, the full body of the content must be included in the post, properly formatted for reddit.

Include an outline & timestamps with a video.

If your blog is over 2000 words you may ask for an exemption.

All other rules still apply.

No blogs about your ""startup"" journey allowed.


#####8.Always Be Kind and Supportive

The goal of this community is to encourage people to learn and be inspired to pursue ventures related to startups.

Do not troll, harass people, or be an asshole. **This does not mean to lie. It means to give support and explain why you don't like something.**

Try to remember people likely do not have much experience yet or might be simply ignorant to what you know.

Be willing to hold a discussion and try to explain your opinion or point of view to the benefit of the entire community.



#####9.No Unscheduled AMAs

We do not allow unscheduled AMAs.

We need to verify and approve all AMAs. 

If you wish to do an AMA you must use the ""Message the Moderators"" feature in the side bar and you must give us at least TWO (2) Weeks Lead Time to organize it with you.

The most important rule is **Just Post**. If you've never had a post or comment removed it means you haven't been posting enough.

Our unique rule is that **all posts need to be titled ""me irl""**. Posts that aren't are automatically removed. 

We do not allow posts that reference suicide. This community is not equipped to handle this topic. If you are feeling suicidal [we have some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.

**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.

**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!

**Don't make posts that request upvotes** or any other kind of reddit metric (gold, comments, etc.). That age of me irl is over.

The best links to click **while you're stoned!** 

Psychedelic, mind-bending, mesmerizing, reality-distorting, or trippy games, video, audio & images that make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!

No one wants to have to sift through the entire internet for fun links when they're stoned - so make this your one-stop shop!

* We are **NOT** a ""reaction subreddit"".

* We are **NOT** a subreddit about interesting or amazing content. 

* We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerizing. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

####RULES  [⇨ FULL VERSION](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki) 

Rules | | Description
---------|----------|----------
1. **WOAHDUDE MATERIAL** only| | **ALLOWED:** Trippy or mesmerizing content that meets [**our listed WoahDude criteria**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only).  This is not a mere ""reaction subreddit"". Don't post content just because it makes you literally say the words 'woah dude'. **NOT ALLOWED:** Rare talents, stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights. Things that are merely cool, amazing or unusual, but not in any psychedelic way.
2.  NO TOXIC BEHAVIOR!| |   Inconsiderate behavior is not compatible with the relaxed stoner atmosphere of our subreddit. [**Breaking this rule may result in a no-warning ban.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_2_-_no_toxic_behavior) Trolling, vote brigading, comment brigading, drama brigading, baiting, harassing, taunting, insulting, spoiling, being antagonistic or needlessly bothering users or mods or will not be tolerated.

#The upside down planet Earth:

In the USA, [flying our flag upside-down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration#Flying_an_American_flag_upside_down) is a sign of distress; an SOS; a plea for help. From Wikipedia:

>""Flying an American flag upside down is not necessarily meant as political protest. The practice has its origin in a distress signal; displaying a flag in this manner is ""a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property""; it has been used by extension to make a statement about distress in civic, political, or other areas.""

At the rate things are going, a whole lot of nations need something like this.

This is a place to engage in healthy discussions about Muslim women in Islam. **Please note that all posts on this subreddit are for WOMEN ONLY unless specifically marked that male participation is also welcome.**


""The best among you are those who have the best behavior."" -Muhammad (saw)

Proper adab is expected at all times. We encourage questions and different opinions but they must be expressed respectfully. We will ban you for being a jerk, being judgmental, or otherwise unsupportive. Even if a sister is doing something haraam, the expectation is that you will keep this as a safe space for her to make the right decisions on her own by not being judgmental. 

 The path to hijab is a difficult one and it is our goal to support the women who decide to take this path regardless of how far along they are on this journey. 

---
Questions and inquiries from non-Muslims are welcome!

---

**Subreddit Rules:**


**Rule 1: Respect is expected at all times**. 

Name-calling, being hostile to one another, attacking other users, attacking racial or religious groups, etc. will not be tolerated. This sub is intended to provide support to women who wear hijab and Muslimahs generally. It is not a debate sub. Please respect differences of opinion, avoid acrimonious arguments, and refrain from downvoting users simply because you practice differently. REPORT Islamically unsound advice or rulings without sources.

**Rule 2: All posts are for women only to answer UNLESS OP has used the ""Male and Female Participation"" flair**

All threads are by default for women-only, unless the specific ""male and female participation"" flair is used.

Threads can be posted by both men and women 

Non-flaired users will have their comments/posts removed. To receive a flair, do NOT message the mods. Post on [this thread to receive a flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/thm8cs/flair_thread_4_comment_here_to_get_a_flair/)


**Rule 3: No Stirring Drama**

Stirring drama is not allowed. Threads made to disparage individuals, users or subreddits will be removed.

**Rule 4: Women-friendly Space**

Keep in mind that this is a women-friendly space, therefore please extend your respect to all users and give special consideration to the fact that the subreddit is targeted towards women which would be the majority of the users.

This rule does not equate to man-hating. We expect respect towards both women and men in this subreddit.

**Rule 5: No Self-promotion**

Self-promotion is not allowed by default and should be limited: constantly posting your own blog posts will result in removal of posts.

**Rule 6: No Spam** 

No spamming on the subreddit; repeatedly posting the same question or content is not acceptable

**Rule 7: Citing Sources** 

You MUST cite your sources if you are giving rulings. Provide rulings and sources at all times.

**Rule 8: NP links when cross-linking**

When cross-linking to posts on other subreddits, np links are mandatory.

**Rule 9: No NSFW**

Sexually explicit or profane content in posts, comments, or via PM's will result in an immediate ban. Sisters who need information/have factual questions about sex, r/MuslimMarriage is a more appropriate sub. Exceptions must be approved by moderators prior to posting. Sisters who are being sexually harassed, please message the moderators.

**Rule 10: Rants are for the Monday rant threads only.**

Rants are to remain for the Weekly Monday Rant threads only.

**Rule 11: Moderators can remove posts at discretion.**

Moderators can remove posts at discretion.

>**Surah An-Noor, Verse 31:** And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss. (English - Yusuf Ali)

-------------

>**Surah Al-Ahzab, Verse 59:** O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

----------------

>Hadith**Bukhari 6:282** '*Aisha used to say:* ""When (the Verse): 'They should draw their veils over their necks and bosoms,' was revealed, (the ladies) cut their waist sheets at the edges and covered their faces with the cut pieces.""

Peace be upon you and welcome to r/islam!

Please read the rules before you participate and [reach out](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/islam) to the moderators if you have any questions or concerns. Have a look at the **[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/index)** as well for resources, FAQs and introductory information.

Please do not engage with and report any comments or posts that break subreddit or site-wide rules to better help the mod team. Thank you!

New to Islam? [Here is some good introductory information!](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1zh1y9/islamic_resources/)

# Rules

**Please have a look at the complete set of rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/about/rules/).**

* We do not tolerate trolling, verbal abuse, disrespect, or comments that incite others based on difference of belief, race, ethnicity, etc.

* Submission titles must be somewhat related to the subject matter. Do not title your post ""I have a question"", instead include the subject, for instance “What is Hajj?”

* Users who post questions regarding the religion on a specific topic should not have their threads derailed or be proselytized about other beliefs.

* Submissions which have been involved in (or deemed as potentially leading to) any form of brigading will be removed.

* NSFW/NSFL posts are restricted and must be approved by a moderator

* Do not give or imply any rulings. You can refer to and cite other rulings given by scholars.

* Familiarize yourself with the concept of [*Ikhtilaf*]( https://web.archive.org/web/20160724005727/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhtilaf). ""When there is a scholarly disagreement on a certain issue, it is impermissible to condemn a person who follows a position that is different from one's own. The requirement to command the right and forbid the wrong does not apply when there is Ikhtilaf upon a position.”

* Always phrase your questions and submissions in a polite manner to ensure proper responses. Keep in mind that the tone you use has a direct effect on the quality of the responses you will receive. Posts may be removed at discretion if we feel the content lacks in civility.

* Any posts that are answered by the wiki or searching for previous threads may be removed.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""*The most perfect believer in respect of faith is he who is best of them in manners.*""

377,goldenretrievers,Golden Retrievers,A heartwarming subreddit celebrating the lovable and loyal breed through captivating photos and heartwarming stories. Join the community for endless adorable moments and engaging discussions.,"Welcome to r/goldenretrievers!
________
**History and Basic Info** 
 
The Golden Retriever is a medium sized dog which was historically used to retrieve animals for hunting parties. Their name was instilled by their love of water and ability to retrieve animals undamaged.

Golden Retrievers have a dense inner coat providing them with warmth and a way to repel water off their body. They are intelligent, and playful thus making them the 5th most popular dog in the United States and 8th in the UK. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever) 

SUBREDDIT RULES

We are pretty easy going here. All we ask is that you do not advertise products or services to anyone, which includes links to third party websites, etc. Failure to comply may result in a ban.

379,Dinosaurs,Dinosaurs: They Rock!,RAWR!,"________________________________

There are only *two* rules for this subreddit, please follow them.  

Only one thing is not allowed:  

1. **No links to anything for sale.**  You're welcome to share a photo of something on an image host, and include a link in the comments, but there may be no submitted links to anything for sale (ie etsy, Kickstarter, Amazon).  

2. Please **do** follow [Reddiquette!](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)  This includes not insulting others.  This is a welcoming place and a place of scientific discovery, not of name calling or attacking anyone.  

Please **don't** [downvote](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting) well written comments just because you don't agree with the opinion.  This is a place for discussion!  

That being said, come on in and share in the wonderful world of Dinosaurs and [Paleontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology)!  

________________________________

This is a sub for dinosaurs. It sounds super obvious, but we need to just come out and say it, because we also allow *a tiny bit of wiggle room*. We have always allowed pterosaurs and pliosaurs, and even sometimes something that isn't one of those (like a synapsid).

So generally, anything dinosaur-related is welcomed here, including some things which are definitely not dinosaurs (like a dimetrodon) but sometimes excluding things that ARE definitely dinosaurs (**this is a SFW sub**).

Comments that are not about dinosaurs don't belong here, regardless of context.

###Submission Guidelines

1. [**Read the FAQ** and search before posting](/r/travel/wiki/index). Avoid repetitive questions. Search the subreddit to see if topics have been covered already. Check our **[destinations of the week](/r/travel/wiki/topic-of-the-week)** page for country and city tips.

2. [Include a **descriptive title**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_use_descriptive_titles). One or two word titles rarely provide enough information. Include the country/region.

3. If submitting an image or video **include context** - [read this section of the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/faq#wiki_.22here_are_my_holiday_photos.21.22). No quotes, selfies, or other clichés: we're not your facebook.

4. Be **[as specific as possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_give_specifics)**: where you're starting, dates of travel, budget, interests, places you've been, things you like and dislike. Visa and passport questions: **state your country of citizenship**.

5. **Check [Google](https://www.google.com)** before posting.

6. **[Present the research](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_show_what_you.27ve_already_found)** you've already done so we don't feel like we're doing everything for you; we are not your travel agents.

7. **Stay around** to answer questions or respond to comments. This applies to all questions, image, and blog posts. Do not delete posts with replies.  

8. **[Low-effort posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_avoid_low_effort_posts)** (""Peru: tell me everything!"", ""Where should I go?"") will be removed without further notice. [**Example of an excellent post**](http://redd.it/1a7y8n)

9. **Do not delete posts after receiving substantive responses**. It's rude to the people that responded and makes it hard for other people with similar questions to find your post.

All text submissions must be in the form of screenshots or archive.is links.** This obviously does not apply to articles, videos, and pictures - it is intended primarily for social media posts and public comments. When posting a screenshot, please include the context (i.e. preceding comments) if relevant. Please do not crosspost threads as they will be removed. See the [Submission Guidelines](https://old.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/wiki/submission_guidelines) for more detail.
***
**III. Don't post screenshots or archive.is links of conversations you have participated in.** Likewise, don't bait or troll for content in other subs. This includes comments on the same thread if it's below 300 comments, and the same chain if the thread is larger. This rule applies to participation, simply excluding your comments from the screenshot does not solve the problem. [Rule 3 FAQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/wiki/faq#wiki_rule_3) 
***
**IV. Submission titles must be a direct quote.** 

Use a direct quote as your title. If the quote doesn't make sense alone, you may include *neutral, non-editorialized* context in the title itself.  Articles must be titled with either the headline or a direct quote from it. When posts do not contain text, titles must be a factual and neutral description of the content. **NEVER include your opinion or bias in the title.** 

A direct quote is an *exact verbatim match* between the title and a portion of the post. Do not paraphrase or editorialize - this includes Spongebob font. 
[**For more details, see the FAQ**](https://old.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/wiki/faq#wiki_rule_4).
***
**V. Do not directly link (and hence page) the usernames of the users featured here.** You can only ping moderators.
***
**VI. Please double check whether the poster of the comment you're about to submit is *actually* American.** Do this by scanning their post history etc.
***
**VII. No low-hanging fruit.** Some topics (such as Trump, Turning Point USA/Charlie Kirk, and WW2 bombing of Japan) and sources from certain subreddits (such as T_D, dankmemes, unpopularopinion, AskAnAmerican, and other far-right sources) are only allowed in the Weekly thread. [**These restricted topics and sources**](https://old.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/wiki/submission_guidelines#wiki_low-hanging_fruit_restriction) are not final and you should check the latest list in the Weekly.
***
**VIII. Only archives/images to Americans saying funny shit is allowed - if you want to tell a tale you can do so in the stickied Weekly thread**, which gets renewed every Friday. Rants and stories are only allowed in the Weekly Anything Goes thread.
***
**IX. Under no circumstances search out the source of the SAS and comment/vote there. Brigading will result in a ban.**
***
**X. Don't be toxic.** We will always be a satire subreddit. Toxicity such as **hate speech and anti-American attitudes** will get your comment removed and possibly get you banned. **Please report toxic comments and users.**
***
**XI. Posts must be lighthearted.** No depressing posts or things that aren't worth posting (eg something an American said that is perfectly reasonable in context). Yes, there are some topics covered that are more ironic than funny, **but certain things just aren't lighthearted like shootings, sexual assault, any event where people are genuinely hurt, racists being racist, etc.** Those types of posts are usually better suited for subs like r/gunsarecool, r/ABoringDystopia, or r/ANormalDayInAmerica.
***
**XII. Posts must be uniquely American.** The easiest way of testing this is to ask yourself whether it's likely someone who isn't American would have said it. Someone being religious or messing up geography is not uniquely American by a long shot, nor are racism or capitalism. What makes something uniquely American is if it's highly unlikely if not impossible to encounter outside the US or from non-Americans.

390,trashy,All things Trashy!,,"[](#/RES-nightModeCompatible) [](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)

# **About Us**

/r/trashy is a *celebration* of trash: people, things, media, etc. that boldly and shamelessly violates social conventions and cultural norms. Satisfy our voyeuristic drives by sharing trashy images, videos, stories, and fashion. 

# Rule 1: **Behave yourself.** 
* Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to Trash^TM are not allowed.
* Bullying is not allowed. 
* Toxic behavior of any kind is banned. 
* To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. 
* No witch hunts.
* Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

# Rule 2: **Submissions must be appropriate for this subreddit.**
* Posts must be a **CELEBRATION** of trashiness, posts about horrible people doing horrible things without a shred of humorous trashiness to them will be removed and you may be banned. 
* No images of those whose ""trashiness"" is clearly the result of a serious mental illness.
* No pictures of people in healthcare settings (e.g. doctor's office, hospital, clinic waiting room) that they didn't take and post publicly themselves (aka no doctor's office creepshots).
* No porn unless it is excessively trashy.
* No child abuse or animal abuse. 
* No child porn.
* No fake trash. 
* No pictures of literal trash, bathrooms, pee, poop, discarded tampons etc
* No posts of horrible, evil, really awful things like gore or death or torture etc.
* No reposts.
* No license plates.
* Remove all family names / usernames from submissions. Any information that can be used to find the subjects posted here is banned.
* All NSFW posts must be marked NSFW.
* No memes / image macros. This includes social media status updates consisting **solely** of memes / image macros.
* Posts must be Trashy^TM of their own accord, context is helpful but not sufficient to make it Trashy^TM.
* Please make an effort with your title.
* All social media posts that do not include a photo must include the comments.
* **No mass-produced novelty items such as bumper stickers, window decals or commonly posted t-shirt designs.** 
* **No violent crimes**
* No medical, political, or historical misinformation.
* **This is not TikTok.**  TikToks and ""Do it for the 'Gram"" type posts will be removed.

***
 [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/2sp32m/rtrashy_has_two_new_rules/) for information regarding  our two new rules.

# **Sidenotes**
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not a post is Trashy^TM. 
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not behavior is excessively toxic. 
* Comment threads with rampant rule breaking will be locked.
* Sexualizing minors will result in an automatic ban.

402,PanamaPapers,News regarding the Panama and Paradise Papers Scandal,Panama Papers and Paradise Papers,"This subreddit has been created to provide a platform for sharing news and background details surrounding the **Panama Paper** and **Paradise Paper** revelations. 

---

**TL;DR: What are the Paradise Papers?**  

The Paradise Papers are a new leak obtained by the Süddeutsche Zeitung. The data includes a total of 13.4 million documents – comprising around 1.4 terabytes – from two offshore service providers, Appleby and Asiaciti Trust, and from the company registers of 19 tax havens.  

The documents show how corporations like Nike, Apple, Uber and Facebook have found ways to reduce their taxes to astoundingly low rates. The Paradise Papers also provide evidence of assets in tax havens held by the British queen, the rock star Bono and Stephen Bronfman, the chief fundraiser for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They reveal the extent to which political elites exploit this secretive world: More than 120 politicians from almost 50 different countries are involved in one way or the other.


**What is the difference between the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers?**

The two troves of documents differ in both source and content. In contrast to the Panama Papers, the present documents don't just contain information pertaining to politicians, athletes and the super-rich, but also to numerous multinational corporations that use the offshore system. Among Appleby's clients are companies like Nike, Apple, Facebook, Walmart, Allianz, Siemens, McDonald's and Yahoo. Because all of the places involved are so-called tax havens, or ""tax paradises,"" the name Paradise Papers was chosen.



**Answers to more FAQ can be found on Süddeutsche Zeitung's website**

[Paradise Papers FAQ](https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659/)

Here is an [overview](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/) of people involved, provided by the ICIJ.

---

**TL;DR: What are the Panama Papers?**

The Panama Papers are a 2.6 TB data leak from one of the worlds biggest offshore bankaccount facilitators, located in, you guessed it, Panama. 11.5 million documents have been evaluated by journalists from over 100 organizations from 78 countries. Their findings will be released continuously, and have been spearheaded by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Guardian and Le Monde.

**What do we know so far?**

Multiple heads of government or close friends and family, and other influential individuals have been involved. These include *Vladimir Putin, Bashar Al-Assad, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson* and *Lionel Messi*.
The Guardian provides a nice quick [summary](http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers) of what you need to know.

Here is an [overview](https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players) of people involved, provided by the ICIJ.

Certain sites are blacklisted Reddit-wide. If you include a link to a blacklisted site, your comment will not be visible to the users. Only the mods will be able to see it, and we will remove it to clear the modqueue. This is not the sub's fault, it's Reddit's fault, so don't blame us. Please don't include blacklisted links in your comments and don't post them, because it's pointless. If your comment or post doesn't show up, that's probably why.

Among the sites on Reddit's blacklist are zerohedge, gateway pundit, bitchute, globalresearch, almost anything Russian except Moscow Times, and almost anything Reddit deems as 'Russian-backed'. We don't have a comprehensive list because they don't provide one.

""War is a Racket."" - [Gen. Smedley Butler](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html)

""Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.

""We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."" - Karl Rove

Cold Case; For those murder cases that police and the public consider cold, after a few years or decades

Unsolved; For recent cases of people being murdered in the last few years.

Update; News articles related to a person who has been murdered, whether the police or family are trying to get information 

Historical; Cases from centuries ago without a resolution

Solved; Cold cases that finally get resolved with justice for the victim and family

   Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, speciesism, and religion. Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.

Conversations about moderation, rules, bans, and other meta topics take place in /r/metanarchism (message [the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmetanarchism) to get in).

If you are not yet familiar with anarchism, check out our [primer](/r/Anarchism/wiki/primer) or /r/Anarchy101.  

If you want to debate, try /r/DebateAnarchism.

/r/Anarchism is for discussing topics relevant to anarchism. The moderation structure and policies are not intended to be an example of an anarchist society; an internet forum is not a society. If you join the discussion here, we assume that you are an anarchist, an ally, or want to learn more about anarchism. Review the 
[**Anti-Oppression Policy**](/r/Anarchism/wiki/aop) to see how you can help make space for marginalized people.

###Community Rules:
1. Treat others with respect:

 Name-calling, harassment, and threatening behaviour will not be tolerated here. The mods can and will ban you if your behaviour is inappropriate. Otherwise, you will be given a warning.

2. Original UNALTERED black and white photo needs to be included: 

 Every post must include the original UNALTERED black and white photo (it is just a matter of paying respect to the original photographer). If you can provide a link to where you found the photo, that would also be a good thing to add to your post via a comment.

3. Every post title must be an informative title (DATE must be included):

 Every post title must be informative, for example, Name, Location & Date; all other information can be included in the post as a comment. If you are posting a W.I.P. (work in progress), please include that at the beginning of your title and use the W.I.P. post flair.
If no date is known, state at the end of your title, ""Date unknown"".

4. Not see your post?:

 If you are not seeing your post, please politely get in touch through ModMail it is very possible your post may have been caught up in the Spam filter, which is controlled through an Autobot (please don’t be abusive; it will get you Nowhere but banned)

5. A.I colourizations: 

 A.I. is allowed in this sub if it is used as a base colour. Meaning if your colourization is very clearly done with just A.I., the mods can and will remove your post until you can provide evidence that the colourization was done manually or with a little help from A.I.

6. User flairs:

 This sub allows user flairs, so feel free to include your social media handle as your flair.
Rude language will not be tolerated, and the mods have the right to remove your user flair if it is deemed offensive.

 If you would like, you can include a link to your social media pages (FB, Instagram, etc.) within your post, but it must be Photo Restoration and Colorisation related.

9. Using other people's colorised photos:

 Please get permission from the original colouriser before posting, and don't post someone else's colourization just to get Karma (it's selfish and silly)

424,ClintonforPrison2016,"Running log of Hillary's lies, fellonies, and anti-democratic conduct","Have you realized how Hillary Clinton attempts to cash in on politicizing the Sandy Hook Tragety by blaming Senator Sanders as being responsible for it, yet SHE is the one Democratic canidate accepting money from the gun industry?

Pissed off how she has violated federal law by sending Bill   to campaign INSIDE of pilling locations, and manufacturing incidents that lead to voter suppression?

Well you have come to the right place! Post all Hillary's sins and reports of her misconduct here!","Please post articles, official tweets or statements from her or her campaign, and new news stories only. NOT rants or opinion pieces, save those for the comments.

Likewise, keep post titles concise for readers' ease and clarity. Like ""HRC blaims Bernie for Sandy Hook; Is only Dem. candidate accepting gun money."""
425,waronwomen,War on Women - articles relating to the removal of reproductive rights.,Articles relating to the removal of reproductive rights.,"This subreddit is meant to be an aggregator for all news articles pertaining to the current war on women or the removal of reproductive rights. The goal is to have a quick reference for articles as well as a community space specifically to discuss strategies for organizing and protesting, as well as donation drives for candidates who support women's rights. 

Please keep self-posts productive and remember that complaining is preaching to the choir - we're all here because we know the situation is bad.

Currently looking for other mods and an FAQ will be in development as soon as it seems necessary. For now, please start posting articles and make sure to search before you post. Multiple links to the same articles will be deleted."

Stick to addressing the substance of their comments at hand. This rule applies to all speech within this subreddit.
3. **No Viral Videos/Low-Effort content** This includes but is not limited to videos focused on individuals taken without consent or lacking context, macros, reaction-gifs, low quality or common tourist pictures, rants that do not invite discussion or constructive resolutions, and dashcam videos.

Additionally, we do not allow petitions, fundraising, vote-begging, surveys, or referral/promo codes. 

6. **No Duplicate Posts.** One post per story please! We do not allow multiple posts on the same story, unless they add a significant amount of new information. Same goes for pictures, if there's already a picture of today's sunset or storm, post your picture as a comment in it, as subsequent submissions on the same subject will be removed.

7. **Do not editorialize headline.** Do not editorialize the headline, post your opinion in the comments. 

8.  Posts about **crimes** that are low-effort, or do not have a wider impact on the city, will be removed.

Additionally, if you would like to share news with us, please be descriptive about it. Self posts are allowed on the basis that it is a truly happy event and put effort into writing it. Short or vague self posts **will be removed** as this dilutes the feed.

* **No meme posts** - Low effort content such as posting memes (even with a positive message) will be removed.
* **No silver lining stories** - Stories that are rooted in a negative situation with a minor positive outcome are not allowed. Stories about conquering your fears/challenges on the other hand are allowed.
* **Be kind and supportive** - Shaming, mocking, and otherwise negative commentary is not allowed and such content will be removed. You can give feedback *and* be supportive at the same time.
* **Shameless self-promotion is not allowed** - If you want to share a site or channel you created [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhappy&subject=Self+Promotion+Content) first.

###Rules

* 1 - Only post Adventure Time related content.

* 2 - Keep any and all non-official links to episodes and comics of adventure time off of the subreddit‏. Do not ask for, nor give such links. Links of this nature will be removed and the poster will receive a warning. *This includes site names, and links to other parts of the site.* Also do not make posts asking ""Where can I view episodes?"" The answer is Amazon, Hulu, Itunes, DVDs, or Cartoon Network. If you have any other concerns message the mods.

* 3 - Absolutely no racism, sexism, sexual harassment, bigotry, homophobia, transphobia or ableism. We have a zero tolerance policy for it.

* 4 - No AI generated images. Refrain from excessive meme posts/image macros, MRW, MFW or garbage posting. Low effort memes may still be removed.

* 5 - Absolutely no NSFW content allowed (gore, violence, nudity, pornography, etc). If you're linking to a blog or the like that may also contain NSFW content in places other than the linked content itself please tag it clearly as so.

* 6 - Please try to source your artwork by linking to the original source and not an imgur rehost. Give credit to the creator!

* 7 - The Adventure Time animated series has ended in September 3 2018, and as such spoiler tags are no longer enforced, but still appreciated. Please tag spoilers for comics, especially the post finale series. [See this page for more info on our spoiler policy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/wiki/spoilers).

* 8 - Do not post shirt or merchandise links. DO NOT CLICK THOSE LINKS! 99% of them are scams. Ask for moderator permission before posting (legitimate) merchandise links. Send us a message and we'll be happy to allow your post if it is appropriate.

* 9 - You are expected to follow proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette), and treat each other with dignity and respect.

**THE BASIC RULES**

1. **No memes.**   
 Memes are not comedy, even if they are funny. You can post them on r/COMEDYMEMES.

2. **Low quality posts and titles will be removed.**   
Low quality titles such as ""Check this out"", ""Look at this funny video"", ""Downvote me please"", etc. will be removed. Cringe-worthy posts may be also removed.

3. **No spam.**   
Repeatedly reposting content is not allowed. 

4. **No self promotion.**   
This is part of the no spamming rule. Excessively posting your own social media, podcast, etc. is not allowed. In addition, avoid using overly promotive titles such as ""Check out this guy's channel"", ""Subscribe to this channel"", etc. even if you are not promoting your own content. This rule isn't just a subreddit rule, excessive self promotion and spam is considered bad reddiquette.

5. **No NSFW/Gore is allowed on this sub whatsoever.**

6. **No posting garbage.** Vine compilations, try not to laugh videos, clickbait content, meme compilations, articles on non-comedic or non-satirical news fall under this rule. 

7. **Don't harass other users.** 

For full explanation, [read the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/wiki/faq)

**PLEASE NOTE:** 

Please report rule breaking posts if you see them.

The /r/COMEDY spam filter is set to HIGH.  

**If you feel your post has been unjustly caught in the filter**, don't hesitate to message the moderators and ask us to approve it.

You must be a redditor for at least 21 days before your account can post here. This is to help prevent spam. 


URL shortener links are automatically removed, as they are often used to bypass spam filters and it makes moderation more difficult. However, site-specific short URLs such as youtu.be (Short YouTube URL) are okay.


**Check your link** before submitting. Make sure it does not lead to an error 404 page, content that is set to private, etc.

# **Rules**




1. Follow reddiquette - Follow reddiquette and all site wide rules.  No personal attacks on other Reddit users or private individuals.  Expressing controversial opinions is not toxic behavior.  Both direct and indirect personal attacks are subject to removal and/or banning at the Mod’s discretion.  Posts tagged serious or of a serious nature may be subject to higher scrutiny. 

1. Posts should be relevant to Philadelphia, its surrounding counties and/or the region.  PA Politics and government are allowed unless they are clearly not related to Philadelphia.  Shore posts are conditionally allowed.  If you are unsure about whether your post is relevant, message the moderators.

1. Use the weekly threads and related subreddits.  Lost, found, for sale, wanted, and other Craigslist (anything to do with labor, money, or property) posts go on /r/phillylist.  Please see the sidebar for a list of weekly threads.  Please post sports news and articles in their relevant subreddits.

1. No self-promotion or Solicitation.  Posts about local artists, musicians, makers, and small business promotions belong in the Small Business Thursday thread.  Articles from legitimate news sources about these topics are acceptable.  Do not self-promote by posting links to your own blog, twitter account, tiktok, facebook page, etc.  No top level posts soliciting for donations, surveys, petitions, etc. are allowed.

1. Provide Sources.  Historical or archival images should either link to the original source or include an explanatory comment.  All crime or missing persons posts are required to have credible proof - like a news article or a police report - in order to prevent harassment and doxxing.  Citizen App is not a valid source.

1. No Violence. Do not advocate, threaten, or promote actions likely to cause violence or physical harm.

1. No Hate Speech. Content displaying hate speech, racism, bigotry, or similar discrimination will be removed and users posting the content will be subject to bans.

1. No editorialized news titles.  Please keep your views on the topic in the comments.  Please do your due diligence and verify your source.  Do not post screenshots of news articles - link directly to the source.

1. No low effort memes & duplicates.  Do not post content identical to, or closely-related to, content that was submitted in the last three months unless it adds context or new information.  This includes repetitive posts of popular memes.  Do not post low effort content including unoriginal memes, macros, or simple questions.
1. NSFW and Graphic Content - Do not post sexually explicit videos or images, gore, death, suicide attempts, or other similar content.  News sources that include such content are conditionally approved. NSFW content must be tagged.  Images and videos should follow Reddit's sitewide rules about doxxing.

454,newjersey,New Jersey,"News, discussion, and current events for the state of New Jersey","**NewJersey Subreddit Rules (Moderator discretion applies)**

**Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.**

*    R1: No hate speech or trolling: Racism, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, sexism, & hate speech against minority groups, religions, or national origin is prohibited. That goes for language you might have used in other subs.

*    R2: No reposts, redundant content, or old news. Check the queue first before posting.

*    R3: No posts for information or requests for illegal products, services, or activities. No unnecessary violent content.

*    R4: No off-topic posts. Content must have something to do with New Jersey.

*    R5: When possible, link to the original article of a news story, and absolutely NOT a partisan re-write to make a political point. No linkjacking.

*    R6: No links to articles behind hard paywalls (like Wall Street Journal). Soft paywalls are allowed (like NY Times & NorthJersey.com)

*    R7: Headline & link format: No link shorteners or otherwise obscured links, including posts, text, and comments.

*    R8: Articles must be submitted as Links, not as a Self-Post.

*    R9: No ALL CAPS TITLES.

*    R10: Please, don't post a help/advice question needing a local business without mentioning where you are or how far are you willing to travel, etc. It does no good for us to help you find the nearest shoe repair shop in Atlantic County only to find out later you're in Morris.

*    R11: No denying, downplaying, or spreading misinformation about COVID 19 or measures to reduce its spread. This includes: vaccines, quarantines, limits on gatherings, mask wearing, contact tracing, and other public health measures. Moderators can and will use personal judgement when enforcing this rule.


**And finally...**

* Don't drive slow in the left/passing lane.
 
* Don't drive with high beams on while passing traffic.
 
* Don't take up more than one spot in a parking lot.
 
* Don't drive with snow and ice on your car.
 
* Don't shift lanes / make a turn without using your turn signal.

-----

**What to do:**

* Be nice, be funny, be informative. Shitposts may be allowed if they make moderators laugh.
 
* Events! What going on in New Jersey? Post it! (But not NYC or Philly; they have their own subs.)
 
* If you're rude, you better be twice as funny.
 
* If you're self-promoting, it better be good.

* Report accidents, incidents, and closed roads on Waze.

**Laws of Conduct**

~**Law 0. Low Effort** 

Content that is low-effort or does not contribute to civil discussion in any meaningful way will be removed.
	
~**Law 1. Civil Discourse**

Do not engage in personal attacks or insults against any person or group. Comment on content, policies, and actions. 

Do not accuse fellow redditors of being intentionally misleading or disingenuous; assume good faith at all times.
	
~**Law 2. Submission Requirements**

a) Starter Comment - A starter comment is required within the first 30 minutes of posting any Link Post. Starter comments must contain at least 2 of these 3 elements: (1) a brief summary of the linked article in your own words, (2) your opinion of the article or topic, or (3) at least one question/discussion point for the community. 
Text Posts are subject to the same requirements as starter comments if discussing a link or links, or must be equivalently substantive if entirely original.
	
b) Editorialized Titles - Link Posts must use the title of the linked article. This prevents the poster from framing the discussion from the outset. Let the article speak for itself.
	
c) Media Posts - Link Posts to images, videos, memes, screenshots, and [social media] are not permitted. Linking to media in an otherwise substantive Text Post or comment is still allowed.
	
d) Crossposts - Crossposting from another subreddit is not permitted. Substantive original content is exempt from this requirement.
	
~**Law 3. Violent Content**

Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people. Certain types of content that are worthy of discussion (e.g. educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary, etc.) may be exempt. Ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear.
	
~**Law 4. Meta Comments**

Meta comments are not permitted. Meta comments in meta Text Posts about the moderators, sub rules, sub bias, reddit in general, or the meta of other subreddits are exempt.

	
~**Law 5. Banned Topics**

Submitted links must be related to a politician, party, court case, or piece of government policy/legislation/regulation. Occasionally, the Mod Team may decide that a certain topic should be banned from discussion within this community. See our [prohibited topics wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/wiki/banned) for more information.

*Any advice found here ___IS NOT___ legal advice. Reddit is not a substitute for a real lawyer.*

**Guidelines:**

* Do not ask for advice on how to break the law. Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a ""how to"" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.
* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.
* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).
* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.
* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.
* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.
* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.
* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.
* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.
* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.

*Do you think a subreddit should be featured here? Send us a modmail. The only requirements are that they are related to Maryland and have at least 200 subscribers!*

##Rules
1.
Relevance, specificity, and effort. 
All posts must be relevant to Maryland and specific enough for a statewide subreddit. If your post is narrowly focused on an individual area, it may be better suited in a local subreddit. Questions should be asked fully in the title, including location. Low effort, vague, easily searchable, reposts, or perennial just plain silly posts may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.


2.
No personal attacks/Harassment. 
No Personal attacks/Harassment- Name calling, slurs, and other personal attacks are forbidden on this subreddit. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. Harassment and bullying include, but are not limited to: following users to other subreddits, encouraging brigades, and digging through user's post history to find irrelevant or embarrassing information will not be tolerated.


3.
No editorialized titles. 
Do not editorialize titles of articles. Keep the article title as close to the original as possible, though you may add some small extra information if necessary.


4.
Paywall evasion. 
Do not copy the body of an article behind a paywall in an attempt to get around the paywall or post links to websites that enable paywall evasion. A small summary of the article is acceptable.


5.
No Unapproved Solicitation Posts. Posts soliciting donations, volunteers, signatures, etc. need to be approved by the moderators before posting. All posts must have relevance to Maryland.


6.
Request Guidelines 
Request posts must abide by the guidelines set out in the Wiki."
467,media_criticism,Media Criticism,"Content and discussions on the flaws, propaganda, and general bull$#!t in the media.
","Content and discussions on the flaws, propaganda, and general bull$#!t in the media.

The purpose of this sub is to share **videos and discussions that illustrate** problems with the mainstream media such as:

- sensationalism / fearmongering

- distraction from important issues

- euphemism and ""spin""

- controlling the conversation

- discouragement of nuance

The point of this is to make concrete and clear the failings of ""the system"" using examples, so that people can easily gain a gut-experience of the ways in which our systems of public discourse are inadequate.

---

**Rules:**

- All posts require a submission statement, excluding self posts. We encourage users to report submissions without submission statements.  Posts without a submission statement will be removed after an hour.  [For more information on submission statements, please visit our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/wiki/index)

- Be respectful at all times. Disrespectful comments are grounds for immediate ban without warning.

- All posts must be related to the media. This is not a news subreddit. “Media” is defined as newspapers, journalists, news corporations, alternative media, etc. This excludes social media. 

- ""Good"" examples of media are strongly encouraged! Please designate them with a [GOOD] tag

**Not Allowed:**

- Shitposting, trolling, capslock, shill accusations, etc

- State media such as RT, Sputnik, PressTV, etc (used as a source for a claim). However, criticism of these outlets is allowed. 

- Too many duplicate threads / excessive number of posts from the same user on the same day.

- Posts and comments from new accounts and low comment-karma accounts

- Altering Article Titles (posts designated with [GOOD] won't be removed as long as the post title matches the article title) 

Content determined by mods to be **devoid of educational value** will be removed. For instance, any post:

- encouraging partisanship or bias

- inciting outrage

- taking ""cheap shots""

**Note:** Please use the **Report Button** underneath a link or comment to help improve the level of discourse on this sub.
It sends your complaint directly (and only) to the mods so we can remove subpar content.

**This is not a subreddit to post homework questions in. Please refer questions about projects/homework, etc to a more appropriate subreddit such as /r/homeworkhelp**

### [Official FAQ and Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/introduction)

---
---

## Please be sure to read [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/introduction) before posting. 

#The Rules

**1. No Image Link Posts**

Posting images is only allowed as self-post using the photo as an example for the discussion, to either begin a conversation about 
aspects of the example or to ask a photography-related question. The image should be used to support an overall broad and nonspecific 
topic/question rather than the focus of the post. 

If you just want to share an image you've taken, you're welcome to post in /r/photographs, our sister photo sharing sub. Feel free to 
check out the many [other photosharing subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/recommendations#wiki_other_subreddits) 
available on Reddit as well.

**2. Purchasing or Troubleshooting Questions Should Be Directed to the Question Thread**

Questions asking for equipment purchasing advice or troubleshooting should be posted as comments in the most recent Official Question thread, stickied at the top of the subreddit. Before posting, please check our extensive FAQ; your question may already have been answered! When seeking purchase recommendations, please be *specific* about how much you can spend. (See[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/buying#wiki_how_do_i_specify_my_price_range_.2F_budget_when_asking_for_recommendations.3F) for guidelines.) 
If you do not wish to post your equipment purchasing advice or troubleshooting questions to the Official Questions thread we cordially invite you to post your question to /r/AskPhotography instead. They love questions as standalone posts!

**3. No Spam or Self-Promotion**

Any self-promotion content must constitute no more than 10% of your submissions to the sub or Reddit as a whole, per [Reddit's 
site-wide guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). No direct for-profit advertising or self-promotion of any kind is 
permitted outside of the relevant weekly community threads. Otherwise please instead [buy an 
ad](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising). We do not allow any blogspam, advertisements, shortlinks, seeking votes for contests, 
referral links, crowdsourced funding links, circlejerking, karmawhoring, surveys and/or market research, or DAE/ITAP posts. 

**4. Stand Alone Questions Must Contain A Minimum Amount Of Context**

Interesting discussion/questions on broader topics may be permitted as self-posts at the discretion of the moderators. Please ensure you include enough information for your question to be answered or a discussion to be had. Post titles *must include details as to the subject of the post.* 

**5. No Classified Ads or Job Offers**

If you want to sell a photography item to Redditors or want to buy a photography item from a Redditor, please use /r/photomarket. If you just want to share some great photography-related deals, please use /r/PhotographyDeals. If you are looking for a photographer or retoucher to do a job for you, head over to r/PhotographyJobs.

**6. No Rants**

This is not the place to have non-constructive rants about photography or photographic trends that you happen to dislike

**7. No Personal Attacks** 

No personal attacks of any kind. Violations may result in a ban.


**8. Lost & Found**

If you've lost or found a piece of photography equipment, please head over to the [Lost & 
Found](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/vtkmis/photography_lost_found_late_2022/).

**9. Flair is for Portfolios**

Use the flair system only for your portfolio and nothing else! Not allowed for example: Gear, blogspam, shortlinks.

##Guidelines

* **All posts must be Disney related.** All posts must be Disney related. Posts that are only tangentially related to Disney will be removed.
* **Follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**. Treat others with basic decency. No personal attacks, Threats of violence, shill accusations, hate-speech, flaming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstantiated accusations. This will result in a permanent ban. 
* **No reposts, low-effort, trolling or NSFW content.** Submissions deemed to be nonsensical, poorly written, excessively vulgar, obscene, or common will be removed at the moderators' discretion. This includes troll posts or comments with swearing, ranking threads, and conspiracy theories. Posts must also be in English.
* **No clickbait, vague, or misleading post titles.** Posts should have titles that properly convey what the post is about, as well as being logical without any context. Posts that link to articles or videos should contain the original source title within its title.
* **No sales, affiliate links, or begging posts.** Links that, when clicked (or used to purchase/sign up from), give the referrer some form of bonus or compensation are not allowed. For B/T/S posts, please visit /r/DisneyMarketplace.
* **Tag Not Safe for Magic.** If your post 'breaks the magic' (e.g. shows backstage or addresses the mechanics of attractions), please flag with 'NSFMagic' accordingly!
* **No posts relating to politics, religion, or social justice.** Posts which include any mention of politics, religion, or social justice (or concepts, figures, and ideas tangential to those topics) outside of the context of Disney have the unfortunate effect of causing excessive vitriol in the comments. As such, posts about the aforementioned topics (or which include a reference to those topics) are not allowed in this community.
* **No posts/comments about piracy, ad blockers, VPNs, location spoofing, account sharing, or anything that would break Terms of Service agreements.** Failure to follow these guidelines can result in an immediate ban.
* **Always link to the original source** All movie trailers and clips must be from official sources (ie; only trailers from Disney, Pixar, Marvel or Star Wars' official YouTube page). All artwork must be sourced (especially if it's not your own) or it will be removed.
* **No excessive self promotion.** You can post links to articles on your own personal Disney Blog [as long as it meets these guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1qjy7z/new_policy_for_posting_links_to_your_personal/). Account self promotion on this server is not allowed. Do not post accounts you made yourself with the intent of promoting them. This includes your YouTube, Etsy, blog, discord server, etc.
* If you are going to submit an IAMA, [please message the mods first](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdisney).
* **Do not pull down on the safety bar, please**; I will lower it for you. And heed this warning: the spirits will materialize only if you remain quietly seated at all times. Please keep your hands, arms and feet inside at all times. And watch your children, Please.

**Resources**


Check out the [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/wiki/index), where you can find a treasure trove of resources like tutorials, architecture blogs, school information, and more. It's an ongoing compilation, so we encourage you to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Farchitecture) with suggestions for more content!

**Post Guidelines**

Please DO:

* Submit interesting, engaging, and inspiring content relevant to the field, study, or love of architecture.

* Include one of the following bracketed tags in your title: [theory], [practice], [building], [technical], [news], [misc], or [ask]. Posts that don't include them won't be visible!

* Include details such as architect, location, photographer, date and building type in submissions when available. This and additional context should be included in the title or, if space does not permit, in the comments section.

* Feel free to seek advice, discussion, and collaboration with other members of the subreddit!

* [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Farchitecture) with a brief explanation when reporting a submission as spam. 

* Be kind to and cooperative with your fellow redditors. A professional level of civility is expected. 

Please DO NOT:

* Submit job listings or solicit employment from others. It leads to an avalanche.

* Submit blog-spam or exclusively self promote your own websites. This cheapens the overall quality of the subreddit's content. Look into paid reddit ads if you wish to advertise your services or website.

* Solicit uncompensated design work or professional consulting advice from the community. ""It will be great for your portfolio!"" doesn't fly here.

* Jeopardize your academic integrity by asking for others to complete your homework.

* Disrupt discussion by deliberately insulting, trolling or otherwise antagonizing fellow redditors. Aggressive profanity directed at others will get you banned. If you're unsure how to behave like a proper adult, refer to [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette).

* Post ""What Style Is This?"" questions outside of our dedicated stickied megathread.

*These guidelines are monitored by an involved community, so please help us maintain quality content by upvoting, downvoting, and reporting accordingly!*

It’s also not for job-searching or recruitment: please use r/designjobs, r/forhire, r/jobs, or r/picrequests instead. You also cannot promote your own products, services, brand, or shop - including your design services.

2. If posting someone else's work, credit them appropriately. If posting someone else's work, use the 'Someone Else's Work' flair. If posting your own work but it's been heavily inspired by, or has drawn on, elements of another person's design, you must credit them. Claiming someone else's work as your own will result in removal and repeated offenders will receive a ban.

3. All shared work must have a comment for context. You must write a comment explaining any work that you post for feedback. The work’s objective, its audience, your design decisions, etc. This information is necessary to allow people to understand your project and provide feedback.

4. No basic/repeated questions. Please Google your question first, and then use the search function on Reddit to see whether someone else has asked your question already. This also applies to font identification questions: use r/identifythisfont instead.

5. This is not a “homework” forum. This is not a place to pick the brains of other designers to do your job for you. You can ask questions, or post asking for inspiration, but please don’t cross the line to getting other users to do your work for you.

6. No off-topic/non-civil discussion. We recognise that design can be political and controversial. We welcome that content here, but please keep all discussion in the comments civil and focussed on the design. This rule also applies to responding to those who leave critical feedback – please give, and accept, feedback politely.

7. No memes/low-quality posts. Please use r/designmemes instead. This also applies to ""meme"" work (non-serious work created as a joke).

8. Is it suitable for this sub? To separate r/design from the various other creative industry subs, artwork and posts of pieces that have functional purpose should be submitted here. There's various other subs for /r/art, /r/DigitalArt, photoshop work, illustration etc. Artwork here must have been designed for a functional purpose"

**The sidebar is a summary. [Please see our full rules wiki page.](/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules) Mouse over for futher details.**
##  **Rule 0: Be civil**

> No personal attacks, witch-hunts, or inflammatory language. This includes calling or implying another redditor is a shill or a fanboy.

> No racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or other hateful language.

> No trolling or baiting.

> No calls for violence against any groups or individuals.

> Any account less than 90 days old may be permanently banned on the first infraction of this rule.

##  **Rule #1: No spam, porn, or facilitating piracy**

> [**Please see our full rules on self-promotion here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/selfpromotion)

> [**Please see our full rules on piracy here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/piracy)

## **Rule #2:  No advertisements**

> Ads include, but are not limited to, chat/game server & community recruitment (i.e. Discord, TeamSpeak), contextless website or subreddit links, and listings on eBay or other sales platforms.

> No affiliate or referral links: This includes Amazon, GMG tap links, Star Citizen, etc.

> Developers must be [verified](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/developers) before posting about their projects and, once they are, are not bound by rule #2.

##  **Rule #3: No memes, PCMR language, or low-effort posts/comments**

> This includes contextless images/screenshots/GIFs as well as anti-platform or PCMR language such as ""master race"" and calling people peasants.  

> Low effort posts/comments and submissions not attempting to create discussion are prohibited.

##  **Rule #4: No tech support or game help questions**

> Tech support questions can be posted in our stickied tech support thread.

> General game related discussion is allowed, but game-specific help requests (how to defeat a certain boss or level, what loadout is best for my character, etc) and basic questions (is a game co-op, does this game have controller support, etc) aren't. Those questions would be more appropriate for the game's subreddit if it exists.

##  **Rule #5:  No questions about building/buying computers, hardware, peripherals, furniture, etc**

> This includes ""Can my PC run this?"" type questions, links showing off your computer build, or asking questions about builds.

> Game suggestion requests and all their variations belong in the weekly game suggestion thread that runs from Fri - Sun.

> This includes group/clan recruitment. Our Discord has channels for finding people to play with.

> We no longer allow surveys. You can try /r/samplesize.

> Please don’t make requests for spare game keys or PC parts. GoFundMe and other fundraising posts are also prohibited.

##  **Rule #7: No Let's Plays, streams, highlight reels/montages, random videos or shorts**

> In addition to this, Youtube links posted by new accounts are filtered due to channel spamming.

##  **Rule #8: No off-topic posts/comments**

> Keep posts and comments related to PC gaming and the topic being discussed.

## **Rule #9: Use the original source, no editorialized titles, no duplicates**

> Submissions must use the original source when available. **EXCEPTIONS**: Pay-walled and non-english sources and corporate earnings calls.

> Don't editorialize your titles. In the case of clickbait, or content lacking context, you may **lightly** edit the title. Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules#wiki_rule_9.3A_use_the_original_source.2C_no_editorialized_titles.2C_no_duplicates).

497,China,r/中国,"A community for discussing China and topics related to it. All viewpoints and opinions are welcome here, but please read the rules in the sidebar before posting.","######Welcome to /r/China. Reddit is driven by user submitted content. If you want to improve the sub, make a contribution!
##Welcome to /r/China


If you are new, please read our sub rules and guidelines prior to posting and/or commenting. For commonly answered questions, please search the subreddit as your question most likely has already been answered.      
 
**User Flair**: You can select flair to indicate your nationality by clicking *edit* above. 
    
##Sub Rules

- **R1: Be respectful.** No directed offensive language or personal attacks are allowed. Profanity is allowed, but not if it’s directed at others. Racism, sexism, and slurs or similar remarks are not allowed in either English or Chinese, including in usernames.

- **R2: No bad faith behavior.** Bad faith behavior can include combative argumentation or statements intended to disrupt others’ points of view rather than engaging with them, attempts to provoke others into being caustic, making derisive remarks that add little value, or otherwise participating in discussions to the detriment of others. Making extreme unsubstantiated claims or sharing materials that are low in substance but high in outrage may also lead to removal.

- **R3: Media policy.** Memes, images, videos, gifs, and other types of media are allowed but are strictly moderated. Media regarding real life people and events should provide appropriately sourced background context or risk deletion. On a spectrum from daily life musings to cultural commentary to political soapboxing, moderation of media will tighten. Media concerning topics that have already been discussed at length will likely be deleted. See also r/ChinaMemes

- **R4: Post title policy.** Posts with low-effort, editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, or misleading titles will be removed and may result in a ban. In addition, posts linking to news articles or other third-party content in English must match the title of the original source or will be removed.

- **R5: No reposts / One post per topic.** When posting about current events or new developments, please check if there are already other submissions on the topic. We regularly delete subsequent posts about the same topic, even if they provide additional information or context. If you would like to share additional information about something that has already been posted, please do so as a comment in the original thread.

- **R6: Posts must be related to China.** Content that is only tangentially or incidentally related to China will generally be deleted.

- **R7: Submit the best source format.** Submissions should be of the best available source format. For example, twitter posts should be submitted as links, not as screenshots. If your post is removed for this reason, you may resubmit it after appropriately selecting a better format.

- **R8: No meta-drama or subreddit drama.** References to other subreddits that tend to cause drama, or contain Reddit Content Policy violations or other issues such as hate speech or misinformation, will likely be removed. Posts about bans or removals on other subreddits are not allowed.

- **R9: Posts with “(Serious)” flair are held to higher standards.** 

- **R10: Daily posting limit.** Please do not make more than 3 posts per 24 hour period. Posts exceeding the limit are automatically removed, and repeated violations will result in an automated ban.

- **R11: If posting in Chinese, please translate at least the post title / 规则11：如果发布中文贴子，请至少将标题翻译成英文**

For more detailed information, or examples pertaining to our rules, please click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/g0yjqx/read_rules_in_sidebar_before_posting/)

##Other Guidelines

- Got a question? Have you googled it and checked our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki) yet?

- Post Chinese translation requests to /r/translator    
  
- The best place for travel advice is still /r/travel or /r/travelchina but if you must post here, be clear and specific as we are not itinerary planners.

- [VISA FAQ HERE](http://lawandborder.com/faq-new-china-visa-law/). Please submit visa questions to /r/ChinaVisa. 

- No advertising or blog spam.

- Do not create alt accounts for the purpose of attacking another user.  
  
- Positive karma is required to post or comment on /r/China.

- **If your post does not show up, please message the mods.**

## Welcome  

Welcome to /r/yoga! Reddit's best place for all things yoga.  **Yoga can be:** 

* A way to stay fit
* Relaxation, stress reduction
* Just fun
* Preparation for meditation
* Spiritual or religious practice
* or whatever else you need it to be

## The Wiki and FAQ

We do lots of fun things here at /r/yoga.  Check out our [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/index) and the [FAQ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) for info about all things yoga, including equipment, information about different styles, specific situations / conditions, and resources for those new to yoga. 

## Weekly Form Thread

Have a question about your form or a pose in general?  Head to the form check thread that is stickied at the top weekly for guidance from professional teachers.

## Rules

1. **Play nice.**  This is a community of people that share an interest in yoga.  It is meant to be a safe and accepting place that is free of judgement.  Let's all try to keep it classy, not lower ourselves to insults or rude comments, and make r/yoga an inviting place to visit.  Rude or crass comments are subject to removal/ban.

2.  **Before posting, PLEASE use search and read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq).** Many people have posted basic questions before.  Please check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) before posting another 'what-should-I-wear?' type post. The article you're excited to share may have been posted yesterday. Common questions and link reposts may be removed. We will try to let you know why if we remove a post, but it may not always happen. If we don't and you want to know, just ask. 

3.  **Please don't blogspam, advertise, or ask for crowdfunding.**  Occasional links to your blog are okay but please don't post every single time you update your blog.  That will eventually get your blog banned and we don't want to do that. All links to crowdfunding sites will be removed. When in doubt, know that the mods use [reddit's guidelines for self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as a starting point. Surveys, market research, and assignment/research study help will be removed- you can find more info about those in the sticky.

4. **Tag images of a person(s) in asana with [COMP].** If you are posting link to a picture of a person or persons in asana, in any form, you are required to tag it with [COMP] at the beginning of the submitted link's title (Check Out My Pose). Any posted photos/videos disobeying this rule will be subject to deletion. Please report violations. Self-posts with context need not be tagged, nor do full practice videos.  Any posts to personal social media accounts are subject to deletion, per Reddit's doxxing rules.  

5. **/r/yoga is NOT a medical resource.** We don't offer medical advice and we can't tell you if the pain you're feeling is a simple strained muscle or an alien life form incubating in your joint(s). By asking for advice along these lines, you assume all responsibility for the outcome should you attempt anything suggested. That being said: If you're offering advice, please do so mindfully and avoid speaking to topics you don't know about. Blatant misinformation WILL be removed. Multiple infractions may result in a ban.

### Rules!

**Note: we have automoderator set to flag posts that may break these rules so they can be evaluated by the mod team. Appropriate submissions may sometimes get caught by the filter. We’ll get to it eventually, or send a modmail to bring our attention to your missing post if you feel it follows the rules**

**All rules are enforced at the moderation team’s discretion. Please make any rule suggestions, complaints, or disagreements to modmail, not individual DMs or Reddit chat to specific moderators.**

1. Express yourself, but be civil. This includes hate speech, personal attacks, excessive trolling, etc. Harassment will result in a ban.

1. Don't post looking to participate in ANY sort of illegal activity. This includes attempting to source medicinal marijuana, cartridges, etc anywhere aside from a licensed establishment.

1. Please use the search bar/sidebar before asking a question. This includes the wikis! There are plenty of relevant posts that will most likely answer your question. Got a request? Use the ""Where In Orlando"" Wednesday thread!

1. Don't spam! No solicitation (this includes both buying and selling tickets). Don't post surveys. Posts on r/Orlando should be related to Orlando in some way.

1.  That ""boom"" you heard was probably something headed to/from space, thunder, or fireworks from the theme parks. All 3 are completely normal in Central Florida.

1. No editorialized article titles. If linking an article, ONLY use the exact title of the article (shortening for Reddit character limits are acceptable within reason).

1. No links to GoFundMe's or any similar donation site. 

1. [Follow the Reddit Content Policy!](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)

1. **NEW** Misinformation and conspiracy theories are not allowed, including vaccine falsehoods and COVID denialism. Debating is welcome, but stating false claims and opinions as fact is not allowed. This will be enforced at the discretion of the moderation team.

1. Missing persons posts must include the official poster released by the appropriate law enforcement agency. We do this to prevent cases of stalking or harassment.

1. Posts about state politics must directly relate to Orlando. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/11zpi7q/final_update_on_state_politics_in_rorlando/) for a detailed breakdown of this rule and its exceptions.

This is not a place for debate, this is a place to help each other through the trauma of leaving behind an integral piece of our identity. Please be considerate and respectful to each other.","##**Welcome to /r/exchristian!**

We are a supportive community for ex-Christians or those who are questioning their religion. Please feel free to share your thoughts and stories, vent feelings, or just have a casual chat.
We also have a [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/xHRvEVc)

### Are you looking for help? Try our new [Resource wiki page!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/resources)

#### We have a FAQ! [Please read it before posting or commenting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/faq)

##[**Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules)
##1. Your post should be relevant.
 - Posts should be related to ex-Christianity, and/or the ex-Christian experience.

##2. No spam posts.
- Advertising, irrelevant posts, and spam are not allowed and are subject to removal.
 - All self-promotion must be run by the mods first. This includes surveys, videos and other content associated with the poster.  
 - [Read our detailed rules on submitting surveys before submitting them to our subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/surveys) Surveys posted without pre-approval will be removed.

##3. No preaching, proselytizing, apologetics, or provoking.
 - This is not a debate sub. Differences of opinion are fine, arguing over which opinion is (or should be correct) is not. It's important to agree to disagree.
 - Non-Christian opinions and beliefs are welcomed and encouraged. However, do not try pushing your belief system onto others, Christian, ex-Christian, or otherwise.  
- Christians are welcome here only so long as they're looking to learn or seek help. Christians defending Christianity or arguing for their personal interpretations of Christianity (apologetics) will be removed.

##4. Be respectful.
 - Mind the community that you are in. Many people here are victims of traumatic experiences.
 - Though profane language is permitted, rude behaviour towards each other in this sub is not.
 - **This is not a debate sub.** Arguments may be shut down without notice.
 - Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

##5. No low effort posts.

- [Respect the time and effort of the community responding to you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules#wiki_respect_the_time_and_effort_of_the_community_responding_to_you.)

##6. No cross-posting from religious subreddits
-  In order to prevent brigading, you cannot cross-post from a religious sub (r/Christianity, r/Catholic, r/Mormon, etc) to here. You can take a screen shot of a post and post the image but the user's name, subreddit, and other identifying info must be censored.

##7. No personally identifying information.
 - Facebook profiles, reddit usernames, full real names, phone numbers, credit card info, etc. *must* be censored. This prohibition does not apply to the names of public figures who have entered the news.

## 8. Do not contact moderators directly about subreddit-related issues.
 - *All contact to the mods about /r/exchristian-related concerns must be to sent to the subreddit mod mail. Any and all direct messages and chats to the mods inquiring about subreddit issues will be ignored and deleted.*
 - Moderation reserves the right to mute or ban users they deem a disruption to the community as they see fit.

##[**Full rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules)

#If you see a disrespectful user, do not engage; report it to the mods, and move on.

*Warnings will be given to offenders at the discretion of the moderators. Repeat offenders will be banned from this subreddit.*

538,Nicegirls,Nice Girls,"/r/nicegirls

Like /r/niceguys but different","###### [](#h6)
>For all the self-proclaimed ""[nice girls](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Girl)."" For the women who complain ""guys are only interested in sluts."" For women who complain that men are shallow for not dating overweight women, while also demanding that their man have washboard abs. For the women who hold others to the highest possible standard, but have no standards for themselves. 

###### [](#h6)
>This is primarily a subreddit for images of these ""nice girls"" demonstrating their unique charm. Videos, articles, and other content are welcome.

###### [](#h6)
>This sub is not for female incels. This place is not for crazy girls. If you swap the genders and it doesn't belong on r/niceguys, then don't post it. THIS IS NOT A 'MEN ARE TRASH' SUB.

###### [](#h6)
>This subreddit is not a woman-hating subreddit, please refrain from making sexist comments or being a bigot. It will NOT be tolerated. Keep that bullshit out of here. 

##Rules

- **Rule 1**: Post NiceGirls only. If you're unsure if your post shows a nicegirl, look at the definition above.

Things that aren't a nicegirl:

+ a crazygirl
+ hypothetical nicegirl. This includes memes
+ a niceguy
+ women with not enough context to prove ""nice""
+ 'Men are trash' posts

If your post is long, **highlight relevant parts**. No one wants to read 1000 words to find the nicegirl.

**Rule 2**: **NO IDENTIFYING INFO OF ANY KIND. This includes personal info, username, first name, last name, profile pic, faces, Twitter handle, Instagram name and any other username. No public pages or usernames. No watermarks. Censor your own name. There are no exceptions at all. This includes videos. Any infraction of this rule will result in a ban. If we can read the name, or if any of the stated terms are visible AT ALL, you will be banned.**

**Rule 3**: Any form of sexism, insensitivity, racism, or intolerance will not be allowed. This includes posts and comments. You will be permabanned.

**Rule 4**: No low-effort titles. Your title must be descriptive. Anything referencing where you found the post will be removed.

**Rule 5**: No NSFW/NSFL content.

**Rule 6**: No reposts.

**Rule 7**: Nothing from FDS or their affilated subs. 

Content taken from FDS is not for r/nicegirls due to the following reasons:

- Content from FDS is extremely low hanging fruit. They hate us, we hate them, we get it. You're not bringing anything new here by showing it off. 

- Blatantly stating that the content is from FDS will incite brigading of that subreddit. This is against Reddit TOS and we will not tolerate it.

Any content posted from FDS will result in an immediate permaban.

**In sum, remember that ""If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge, if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. (1 Cor. 13:1-2)"" In all things, charity: a post being orthodox or otherwise factually correct does not mean it will not be removed if it is also uncharitable.**

#### Q&A

**Q:** **How is r/Catholicism different from r /Catholic?**  
**A:** r /Catholic is run by anti-Catholic trolls ([see this news item](https://web.archive.org/web/20150719151100/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/16/reddit-decency-reckoning-ellen-pao-trolls)).  Our much larger subreddit is actually devoted to discussing Catholicism. 

**Q:** **How is flair used here?**  
**A:** Currently, we use flairs for offices. If you see users flaired, they have been verified by the moderators. We are unlikely to have self-applied flair anytime in the near future (search for the topic here to understand why).

###***Girls:*** Like the idea of seeing yourself coated in cum? Ever wanted to *see* the seminal satisfaction your pics can bring? Fancy a fantasy facial?

####*Try a Tribute!*

**We're all about good ~~clean~~ _dirty_ fun.**

_""It might seem weird at first, but seeing yourself covered in guys' cum is strangely arousing, curiously satisfying, and surprisingly fun. It's like having a memory of something you never actually did. Being able to try it and talk about it openly, safely, and in a supportive environment, is pleasantly liberating... and somewhat addictive; you can't understand until you've tried it yourself!""_ - anon.

TributeMe is the home of consensual cum tributes. Verified ladies request tributes to their photos or videos, and other Redditors share their *appreciation* for all to see. Video cum tributes preferred, but all tributes welcome.

Posting here is not an invitation to chat, message, cam, or hookup.

**Tributees**: **[Verify](https://www.reddit.com/r/TributeMe/wiki/verification)**, then post your pic or video as a tribute request. We accept Reddit-hosted images (must post from Reddit app), Redgifs videos, and Imgur images and videos (must directly link to the pic or vid, not an album). Don’t feel bad about blocking private messages or chats.

**Tributers**: Record your tribute, upload it to Erome, Redgifs, or Imgur, and then share the link in a comment on the post you’re tributing. (Tributes must include the pic or vid from the post.) Also include the appropriate tag in your comment:  [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]. (If you don't have a cock, please feel free to make up your own tag.) 

To reply to a tribute request, you must have actually shared a tribute. For your first comment, just include the appropriate tribute tag (rule 15), and a moderator will review it to confirm that it contains a valid tribute (rule 13).

**EMOJI FLAIR**

Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTributeMe) if any of this flair is appropriate for you or someone else (except wait 24 hours for 👻 and 💦—those are applied automatically once per day). Include link(s) to the relevant thread(s). Also let us know if you have any other flair suggestions.

**Tributees**:  
🦄 for a ""reverse tribute"" (publicly shared video of touching herself with a tribute in view).  
💖 for a particularly thoughtful reply to a tribute, mentioning something specific in the tribute.  
👻 for not replying to tributes. If a [cum vid] tribute is posted within the first 24 hours of your request, you have 24 hours to reply to at least one [cum vid] tribute in order to avoid the 👻 label. You can remove the 👻 by replying to tributes.

**Tributers**:     
💦 for posting a public cum video tribute.  
🏜️ for if a tributer comments three or more times in a thread without sharing a tribute within 24 hours, they will lose tributer status and will not be able to comment again until they share a new tribute

---
**RULES**

1\. **All users must be 18 or older**.

2\. **Tribute requests must come from verified females**. See [verification instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TributeMe/wiki/verification). (Trans women and couples accounts with her consent are allowed.) If you delete your verification post or photos, your verification will be revoked.

3\. **No promoting or selling in TributeMe**. Accounts that sell elsewhere are allowed, but only if they're generating sufficient tributes. See details in the **[Seller Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/TributeMe/wiki/seller_policy)**.

4\. **No more than one request post per 20 hours**. If you make a mistake in your post, you may delete it within the first 30 minutes and repost right away. Verification posts are exempt, so you may post again as soon as you're verified.

Album/gallery posts are allowed, but they must be from a single photoshoot. Please do not dump a bunch of unrelated photos in a single post.

5\. **No TributeMe reposts**. Material you've posted elsewhere on Reddit is welcome. 

6\. **[Meta] posts are for general discussion of tributes**. Anyone may submit a discussion text post with a [Meta] tag in the title, but requesting or offering tributes in [Meta] posts is not allowed.

7\. **Keep it real (no significantly altered photos or videos)**. Cropping, color balancing, and blurring/censoring sensitive parts is allowed; changing the size or shape of body parts is not. Faking or re-using cumshots is not allowed, and her request must naturally be in the frame, not edited together as a composite.

8\. **Be respectful**. Negative, offensive, or discouraging comments are not acceptable. Degrading terms like slut or whore are only allowed if the requestor specifically asks to be degraded. 

9\. **Do not mention or ask for usernames for other services**. This includes Kik, Snapchat, Skype, email, carrier pigeon, or anything other than Reddit. You may put other usernames in your profile, but you may not mention them in TributeMe.

10\. **Do not mention private messages or promise anything in exchange for tributes**. TributeMe is at its best when tributes and replies are public for everyone to enjoy. If you have earned reverse tribute flair (🦄) you may mention that you will reverse tribute your favorite. If you do not post a reverse tribute within a week, you will lose the 🦄.

11\. **Do not ask if a requester wants a tribute or how to send a tribute**. If they’re posting here, they want tributes. Record your tribute, then upload it to Imgur, Erome, or Redgifs, and share the link. If you are honestly confused, message the mods or make a [Meta] post.

12\. **Do not attempt to identify anyone**. Privacy must be respected!

13\. **Cock or cum pics/vids must include the request and must not contain other pics/vids**. Do not post a tribute of a different pic/vid.

14\. **Do not link to a video until it finishes encoding**. If Erome is taking too long, try Redgifs!

15\. **Tag your tribute as [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]**. Include the appropriate one in your comment. If your tribute does not fit into one of those categories, please make up your own tag and message the mods so we can approve it."

* What makes a good FPS? Read a few, you'll pick up on what's good and what isn't pretty fast. 
* It's all not always fun and games, be prepared to experience all spectrums of rage, lols, and feels. And expect to be permanently grossed out.
* This sub is a place for you to tell us about hamplanets in your life and your relationships/encounters with them. Remember that hamplanet is not *just* about the weight, but also the hamentality - rudeness, entitlement, fatlogic, etc. Not all fat people are hambeasts but all hambeasts are fat people. 
* Please adhere to [Reddiquette](http://en.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) along with our community rules, which can be found at the top of the sidebar.

568,amibeingdetained,P. Barnes 4 President,"/r/amibeingdetained is a subreddit devoted to showcasing the idiocy and ignorant behaviour of the self-proclaimed [freemen on the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemen_on_the_land) and [sovereign citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement). The phrase ""Am I being detained?"" is a reference to a common catch-phrase used by these movements.","/r/amibeingdetained is a subreddit devoted to showcasing the idiocy and ignorant behaviour of the self-proclaimed [freemen on the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemen_on_the_land) and [sovereign citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement). The phrase ""Am I being detained?"" is a reference to a common catch-phrase used by these movements.

According to Wikipedia, Freemen on the Land are people who claim that all statute law is contractual, and that such law is applicable only if an individual consents to be governed by it. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of government jurisdiction, holding that the only ""true"" law is common law, as they define it. The ""Freeman on the land"" movement has its origins in various United States-based groups in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching Ireland and the United Kingdom soon after 2000. The FBI considers those sovereign citizen extremists who tag themselves ""Freemen"" to be a domestic terrorist movement.

Essentially, these people believe that the law which governs them is the law they create themselves. Subsequent to becoming a freemen on the land, one will eventually discover that their philosophy has no merit in the court of law and that their shenanigans are laughed at as they are posted on websites such as YouTube.

While other subreddits are devoted to hating police and authority figures, this subreddit is in the interest of those who want to laugh at the spastic civilians on the other side of the policing spectrum.

Rules:

* No fighting, hating, or abusing other people. Keep it friendly.
* Don't stray away from the theme of idiotic civilians and freemen on the land; irrelevant posts are not welcome.

If you have any questions, just message the moderators. Please report any posts or comments that are against the rules. Thanks for viewing this subreddit, and please feel free to subscribe.

## [Please Read the Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/about/rules/)##

And the FAQ post, which is stickied right at the top.

Breaking any of the rules will at least lead to post/comment removal, but this can be reversed if we need to make an exception. **If you believe your post was wrongly removed, feel free to [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fclassicalmusic).**

## Things to Know

* If you're new to classical music, and are looking for recommendations: first of all, welcome! /r/classicalresources is an archive for people who aren't sure where to start or are looking for more music they'll like, and we send all requests for basics over there. In addition to that, if you're posting an extremely frequently asked question, you may be told to use the search bar to look for similar posts. 

* If you see something that is rude, offensive, or otherwise strikes you as wrong, please report it and we'll take a look. Reports bring things to our attention faster, and posts and comments above a certain number of reports will be automatically removed (with exceptions as needed).

* Posts from accounts under a certain (small) amount of karma must be manually approved by a mod in order to appear in the feed.

* Remember that not everyone has the same tastes. If you can't tell why anyone would like a particular composer, don't be afraid to ask rather than dismissing them as ""overrated."" (On that note, please don't insult others for liking or disliking a specific composer!) And if you're feeling alone in your love of a specific composer, feel free to post some works of theirs that might intrigue others.

* We acknowledge that the term ""classical music"" is somewhat porous. While this sub is *absolutely not* limited to Western classical music, that is currently its main focus.

##Resources##

* **/r/classicalresources** - A variety of resources to help you expand your classical knowledge. Contains guides for beginners, an index of important composers and their works, and lists of classical pieces organised by genre, era, and theme.

[](/faq) **[The FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/wiki/index)**  ·  

**r/BrisbaneSocial**

Where the tunnels are being dug, and it doesn't get cold,
and every other thread now seems to get trolled.
Where the river is brown and the traffic is tight
and police will tase you if you're looking to fight.

Where George St holds the state's people of power
and brothels are plentiful and charge by the hour.
Where the dust settles for an Eastern coast rest
and parking in the city is a hell of a test.

Where buses and bikes rule with a cold, iron fist
and trains may as well not have a time-list.
Where there's lockouts in clubs that cause more strain
and hundreds of drunken louts stuck out in the rain.

Despite all its flaws, the fact does remain
it's an awesome city, and is far from being lame.

Beautiful Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. Please please please don't swim in the river.

###Rules
[^(We have a set of etiquette guidelines that we expect users to adhere to »)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/etiquette/)

#**Be respectful: We have zero tolerance for harassment, hate speech, bigotry, and/or trolling** 
- When posting in our community, you should aim to be as polite as possible. This makes others feel welcome and conversation can take place without users being rude to one another.

- If your entire online personality is to be negative, this isn’t the place for you. You can disagree, but if you intentionally try to get a rise of people, it will be removed and/or subject to a ban.

- This is also not the place to share anything offensive or behave in an offensive manner.

#**Encourage conversation in your post** 
- Provide context in the submission text that directly relates to the title. Please no nonsensical ramblings or annoying formatting.

- Avoid simple questions with specific answers, Generally, questions with a specific obtainable answer do not provide an avenue of discussion and are usually quickly answered or ignored.

- The intent of your post should be to spark conversation, so it can help to ask leading questions.

- [More Details >](/r/CasualConversation/w/rules/encourage_conversation)

#**Don’t post to vent, complain, or express sadness** 
- Stay positive. Negative topics don’t lend themselves to casual conversation.

- We are a place where everyone can forget about their everyday or not so everyday worries for a moment. Venting, complaining or expressing sadness doesn't fit the atmosphere we try to foster at all.

- [Recommendations >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/venting/)

#**Avoid topics of negative mental health and hardship**

- These topics are not considered casual and our community is a place to escape from more serious issues.

- Stories of overcoming negative mental health or hardship can be acceptable by mod discretion if the focus of the post is positive enough and won't lead to negativity in the comments.

- [Recommendations >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/mental_health/)

#**Avoid posting about problems with relationships, medical or mental health, and legal issues**

- This isn't the place for medical or mental health advice, including asking for a medical diagnosis, or how to deal with illness, injuries, or mental disorders.

- Legal advice questions are better suited for professionals who are knowledgeable of the law and legal proceedings.

- Stories involving relationships are acceptable if they aren't inherently focused on it and you're not looking for advice. 

- [Recommendations >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/advice/)

#**Avoid controversial topics and Reddit meta-drama**

- Loaded questions or statements could spark an emotional response and get people riled up or start controversy.

- Avoid topics that are religious or political in nature. Don’t push an agenda, force beliefs onto others, or belittle another user's view.

- [Reccomendations >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/controversial/)

#**Keep it clean and SFW: No illegal content or anything gross and inappropriate**

- This includes discussion on explicit sexual content, bodily functions, explicit drug use, and other illegal content.

- If you think you need to flag your post NSFW, it is likely not appropriate to post here.

- Laws vary by region, so use your best judgment.

- [More Details >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/sfw/)

#**No solicitation such as ads, promotional content, spam, surveys etc.**

- No buying/selling/trading, referral links, or any link that you will profit from (either virtually or physically).

- This also includes (but is not limited to) promotion of YouTube channels, Spotify, bandcamp, etc. This is not the sub to attempt to get more views/hits.

- Surveys are not allowed as they do not promote conversation.

#**Respect privacy: Don’t ask for or share any personal information**

- As stated in our [PI PSA](/r/CasualConversation/w/pi) there will be zero tolerance for sharing or seeking personal information that could identify someone (real or fake). No private personal information of any kind should be posted online - real name, location, address, workplace, ID numbers, phone, or private e-mail, neither yours (we don't know if it's yours or not) or anybody else's.

- [More Details >](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/privacy/)

###Moderation Policies [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCasualConversation#mods)
#Message the mods for any issues
- Seriously, we ain't that scary >:)
We're happy to help with any issues, concerns or random queries you have. We're here to help you! [Message us!](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/CasualConversation)
 - Most posts *may* be reapproved, send us a mail and we can help you to get your thread back up.
 - If you think your submission may have been caught in our spam filter, mail us for approval.
 - If you want to appeal a ban, we'll try to come to an agreement. 

#Popular Posts
- When a thread has gained a lot of activity, been highly upvoted, and has attracted a lot of outside users, we tend to be a bit more heavy-handed on the removal of comments and the banning of users, as often they haven’t read the rules or understand the environment we try to foster here.

#A Grain of Salt
- We as mods don't usually require verification for posts. If the OP would like to reach out and verify their story with us (or edit the post with verification) then they are free to. Other than that, we cannot say if a story is true or false. Take each story posted with a grain of salt. 

#Removal & Warning
 - Abusive posts of any kind are subject to an immediate ban.
 - Posts that derail discussion with the deliberate intent of provoking other users will be removed:
 - NOT OK: Personal Attacks
 - NOT OK: Hate Speech: False Facts, Flawed Argumentation, Divisive Language, Dehumanizing Metaphors, and/or Slurs
 - NOT OK: Unsolicited sexual advances

#Follow Reddit's official policies 
- [We enforce reddit's official site wide policies & informal values »](/r/CasualConversation/wiki/etiquette#wiki_reddit.27s_official_policies)
 - [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) are Reddit's official site-wide rules.
 - [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an informal expression of the values of many Redditors, as written by Redditors themselves. Please abide by it the best you can.

#####**Rules**


Repeat offenses against the following rules are grounds for a temporary or permanent ban. 

1. No admissions related posts. Questions about admissions should be directed to more appropriate sites (i.e. Harvard Admissions Office, CollegeConfidential, /r/ApplyingToCollege, etc). This includes transfers, waitlists, and application questions as well as questions about current student's admission stories and statistics. 

    a. All HES posts must adhere to the requirements outlined in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/huztou/new_automod_and_new_rule/) post.
2. No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored events, products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*

5. Posts must be directly related to Harvard and specific (i.e. no general ramblings).
6. No clickbait or spam link posts (including news, videos, etc). Any news posts must come directly from a Harvard affiliated news source (e.g. The Crimson, The Harvard Gazette, etc) or a similar reputable source.


If you feel your post was removed wrongfully, send us (the mods) a message! The automod tends to be overly strict.

#Community Rules
In addition to [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy), please familiarise yourself with the following:

1. You need to be the very best, like no one ever was. Treat everyone with respect and engage in good faith.
* All content must be either Nintendo news from the original source or discussion about Nintendo games, systems and products.
* Discussion should be open-ended and seek different opinions. Content with neither context to inform nor prompts for discussion are not substantial enough for a post.
* Posts should have clear, descriptive titles that properly convey what the content is.
* Don't be shady. No buying, selling, trading, or begging. No affiliate/referral links. No enabling piracy or sharing illegal content.
* All giveaways and contests must either be held by Nintendo or approved in advance by messaging the moderators.
* For your own safety always wear a wrist strap when browsing Reddit.

Our moderation policy is not to keep track of every rule infraction, and everything is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, we do ban users who make personal attacks or buy/sell/beg.  We will try to tell you how you can resubmit, or recommend a more a suitable subreddit. However, please read other subreddits' rules before submitting there.

Please be considerate when discussing plot details for games new or old. Don't put spoilers in post titles at all. Putting text into this format will hide spoilers: [Nintendo]\(/spoiler) becomes [Nintendo](/spoiler).

You can also [read the rules in more depth](/r/nintendo/w/about/rules) on our wiki.

The rule serves as protection for anyone to explore and share their identity without prejudice or harm.

The use of the “[No True Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)” fallacy or any other perspectives that denigrate or marginalize individuals based on their identity is strictly prohibited. This also applies to non-Muslim and LGBTQ+ communities.

Any insistence that a party or group must have a specific identity or ideology is not allowed. For example, “All Egyptians have to be conservative/progressive/moderate.”

Instead of:

- No, we/you are [Egyptian/Arab/Pharaoh/African/etc.]

Use:

- I am/identify as [Egyptian/Arab/Pharaoh/African/etc.]

#9. Posting Personal Data

[Personal data](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en), as in any information related to an identifiable person, whether directly or indirectly through one or more factors, is not allowed. This rule also applies to seeking or requesting such data from users. We advise you not to share your own personal data. This rule does not apply to publicly available information on public figures.

#10. Novelty Accounts are not allowed

Accounts that are solely created for any of the following criteria will need approval from us and are otherwise banned: 

- Trolling. 

- Mimic other users or public figures or entities. 

- Bots. 

- Advertising.

#11. Moderator Rights

Moderators reserve the right to take any action they deem necessary to ensure quality of content and discussion.

Choosing to participate in this community is an Implicit acceptance of all the rules of this subreddit.

#Please Do:

Upvote interesting posts regardless of whether or not they agree with your own opinions.

 [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEgypt) to suggest changes that you think would benefit /r/Egypt as a community.

#Please Don't:

###Submission Guidelines

1. [**Read the FAQ** and search before posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/flights/wiki/index). Avoid repetitive questions. Search the subreddit to see if topics have been covered already.

2. Be **as specific as possible**. Provide: where you're starting, where you're going, dates of travel, budget, and airlines or alliances.

3. [Include a **descriptive title**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/faq#wiki_has_anyone_been_to....3F). One or two word titles rarely provide enough information for people to bother contributing to the discussion. Include the destination.

4. Consider whether your question can be answered by **[Google](http://www.google.com)** before posting.

5. **Present the research** you've already done so we don't feel like we're doing everything for you; we are not your travel agents.

6. **Stay around** to answer questions or respond to comments. This applies to all questions, image and blog posts.

7. **Low-effort posts** (""How to find the cheapest flight?"", ""How do I get to Peru?"") will be removed without further notice.

8. Image and Video posts are discouraged.

Welcome to /r/hardcore- a subreddit dedicated to hardcore music! 

**Please take a moment to read our posting guidelines!**
____



 **POSTING GUIDELINES**

\* Hardcore is a broad genre, used to describe many styles of music, but the focus of this sub is on the Hardcore Punk genre that originated in the late 1970s. We’re a democratic sub that mostly allows the user votes to decide what is Hardcore and what is not, so if you post a band that toes the line, don’t be offended if you’re directed elsewhere. Check out our Friends and Family list to see if your post would be more relevant in another sub.

\* News and discussion posts are encouraged. New tours, music, bands, etc. are encouraged as well as older bands and songs. We don’t have a banned artist list, but try to refrain from just posting popular songs and bands that everyone already knows and loves.

\* Hardcore is at its core a DIY genre. Bands and labels are typically funding their releases and tours out of pocket. Pirated content or leaks will be removed, as well as any posts soliciting pirated content/leaks. 

\* Promoting your own band/label/etc. is allowed. We do ask that you contribute to the sub in ways other than exclusively plugging your own projects.

\* Use of hate speech of any kind will result in a permanent ban without warning. Racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, etc. and general disrespect of other users will not be tolerated. Hardcore is obviously not immune to controversies surrounding these issues so keep any debates or discussions civil. If you're here from another sub to brigade or start shit, you will be banned without warning.

\* Download codes must be posted in the stickied download code thread. 

\* Avoid low-effort meme posts. Low-effort shitposts may be removed at the moderator's discretion, but for the most part we let the upvotes and downvotes sort it out. 

\* Our spam filter is pretty strict towards new accounts to combat the porn bots, so please refresh the page after posting anything. Message us if your post isn’t showing up and we’ll approve it.

**Everything related to The Simpsons!** Check out /r/SimpsonsShitposting if that's your thing. 

*(Images, videos, quotes, news, articles, thoughts, trivia, etc.)*

Note: The Simpsons have made fun of politics pretty much since its inception and there will be political posts from time to time because of that.

# Rules and Guidelines

* **Pay close attention to [the rules & guidelines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQR-cPXlmY)**
* Please use spoiler tags when necessary:`[X Kills Y](/spoiler)`, ex: [X Kills Y](/spoiler).  
* Hate that it has to be said, but personal attacks, racism, slurs, etc are not allowed and will lead to a ban. Let's just laugh at the Simpsons.
* No NSFW stuff, thanks.
* No meme templates talking about things not relating to the Simpsons. No rewriting quotes to talk about things not relating to the Simpsons. Referencing the real-world is fine (e.g. Simpsons Did It) but no full on re-purposing of quotes to talk about unrelated topics. Use /r/SimpsonsShitposting for that.
* The Simpsons has always had politics within the show. So some political posts are allowed, but if you're completely changing a quote/image just for political reasons it can be removed. 
* We no longer will allow you all to shill the MALK company's products and now remove them. [We get it, MALK is a real thing.](https://reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/search?q=title%3A%22DRINK+PLENTY+OF%22+OR+%22malk%22+OR+%22vitamin+r%22&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) We also won't let you shill the Eddie Stobart trucking company.

____________________

#/r/podcasts Rules:

# **1. Self-promotion**

Self-promotion is not allowed unless your podcast directly relates to a newly posted thread AND you clearly disclose your involvement with it. Self-promotion can be no more than 10% of your total recent involvement with r/podcasts. Self-promotion posts are NEVER allowed. Failure to comply will result in your posts being removed and/or you being banned.

# **2. Podcasting**

This subreddit is geared towards podcast listeners. Posts made by podcast creators about podcast hosting, editing gear, starting a podcast, etc. are not allowed and will be removed.

# **3. Service solicitation**

Service solicitation posts (e.g. ""I'm looking for an editor for my podcast"" or ""I'm an editor looking for work"") are not allowed and will be removed.

# **4. Frequently Asked Questions and Recommendations**

Some questions are asked very regularly and have already been answered before. Similarly, many recommendation requests are seen commonly. If your post is a FAQ or common recommendation request, a moderator may remove your post. 

Check the FAQ section of the wiki for more helpful info. If your question is still unanswered, then you can ask your question in the stickied weekly thread.

# **5. Feedback and content requests**

Feedback requests and idea searches are not allowed in this subreddit. This is not a place to think of an idea for your podcast, a niche to cover, a podcast name, or how to present your show. Please use the search function to find what you are looking for, or check out other subreddits.

# **6. Bashing posts**

Bashing posts are not allowed. Posts centered solely on bashing a podcast, genre, ads, mouth noises, live shows, digital media company, podcasters, something that annoys you about podcasts, etc. are not allowed. These do not contribute positively to conversation and will be removed.

# **7. Other post requirements**

* Posts must be made in English and related to podcasts. 
* Spam posts with unhelpful, unrelated, or non-meaningful content will be removed.
* Posts containing links only and other low effort posts will be removed.

# **8. Low Karma**

New Redditors with low karma scores may find their posts and comments removed by the automod. You must have both a post and comment karma score above our minimum to participate in r/podcasts. **Do not** reach out to us via modmail to ask our karma minimums, as we will not disclose them. 

# **9. Reddit's Content Policy**

Express yourself freely, explore strange new worlds, and boldly go where you've never gone before. But remember the Prime Directive of Netiquette: Those are real people out there. This means follow [site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and be civil to one another.

## [**Rules & Guidelines**:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/about/rules/)
^^In ^^no ^^particular ^^order

* **Always practice good** **[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)**.

* **No personal attacks or harassment.** - Do not direct insults or attacks at another user. Don't be a jerk, you will be banned. Specifically excluded from this rule are Nashville public figures, like government officials, local ""celebrities"" or business owners who put themselves in the limelight.

* **No doxxing or sharing of personal contact information.** No personal phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, etc. No pictures of cars with visible license plate numbers. 

* **New, throwaway, & alt accounts cannot make posts.** Posts from accounts with low karma will be automatically removed. So before making a post with your throwaway, interact with the community a bit and auto-removal won't happen.

* **No commercial accounts or crowdfunding.**  Reddit's site-wide rules prohibit accounts made for businesses, organizations, or projects. If you want to occasionally promote something you're doing using your human reddit account, follow reddit's site-wide rules for content promotion (9-to-1 rule). Beyond that, reddit recommends buying ads. No crowdfunding, petitions, coupons, referral programs, promo codes, giveaways, surveys, or paid/unpaid studies, etc.

* **Please flair your posts.**

* **Use the title from the article you are submitting.** No over-sensationalized headlines. Do not title posts with personal opinion and click bait phrases in the headline, feel free to post your opinion in comments though.

* **No ""for sale"" or ""want to buy"" posts** - Please direct all 'For Sale' or 'Want to Buy' posts to /r/nashvillebuyandsell. **This includes tickets that you aren't giving away for free!** If you do not specify that you are giving away your tickets in your post; it will be removed and you might lose subreddit privileges. 

* **No direct links to social media or screenshots.** Posts linking directly to or screenshotting social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. or monetized media platforms like YouTube will be removed. Excluded are emergency notifications.

* **Visiting questions belong in /r/visitingnashville** Visiting questions such as requesting recommendations for your trip, where to stay, what to do while you are here, where to eat on your trip, general questions about Nashville from a tourist's perspective, etc. all belong in r/visitingnashville. If we review your post and discover that it is regarding this topic, it will be removed and you will be directed to r/visitingnashville.

* **Missing pets, persons, and/or lost/stolen item posts must follow these guidelines:** In line with r/MissingPersons guidelines, all missing person submissions must come from a verifiable, trustworthy source (i.e. news station, police BOLO flyer, etc.). Social media sites do not qualify as a verifiable, trustworthy source. Please direct users to send you a message via Reddit if they find your pet, but if it is a missing person, you must go through the local police department, not directly to any individual; yourself or otherwise.

* **If you see a rule being broken, report it.** But please remember, abuse of the report button to attempt to silence a person, group, or message is investigated by reddit staff at a site-wide level and could result in losing all your reddit privileges.

* Job listings go to the monthly [jobs posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/wiki/jobs) or /r/nashvillejobs.

* If your post isn't showing up, and complies with the rules above, feel free to [send us a message about that too](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Nashville&subject=Can't see my post&message=).

* All posts, comments, subreddit actions, and interactions are subject to approval and or removal at moderators discretion, with or without warning.

#[General Participation Guidelines and Rules Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_general_participation_guidelines_and_rules_overview)
##[15-Second Guide to Posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_15-second_guide_to_posting.3A)

###Rule #1 - Civility

We encourage users to be positive and respect one another. This means being kind to those you disagree with, attacking arguments, not people, and avoiding behaviors such as shaming, mocking, advocating violence and threatening (including threats of self-harm) other users, third parties, groups, or businesses.

Be excellent to each other.

###Rule #2 - Inclusivity

Respect others' differences, be they race, religion, home, job, gender identity, ability, vulnerability, or sexuality. When faced with a removal or ban, ""I was just joking!"" or ""it was obviously sarcasm"" are not acceptable excuses.

Dehumanizing language and slurs are instant bans. 

###Rule #3 - Accuracy

Do not deviate from news headlines when sharing news articles. Save your opinions to the comments within the post. Avoid posting information that can be easily proven false, including science denial like anti-vaxx messaging or disputing climate change. 

Posts about bad experiences or missing people without police file numbers or verifiable news reports will be removed.

###Rule #4 - Relevancy

All submissions should be relevant to Metro Vancouver and the surrounding areas. Topics of interest about British Columbia or national stories with a local connection may be allowed at the mod team's discretion. 

Off-topic submissions will be removed, including buy/sell threads, posts about federal issues like border crossings, passports, or flights, and generic questions. Giveaways of free items are permitted (see the FAQ). 

###Rule #5 - Unique Content

**Please focus on unique submissions.** Check for duplicate posts before posting. PSAs and rants are not allowed. 

We get a lot of questions about common topics, such as moving to or visiting Vancouver, or where to find specific items. Common questions are limited to our Stickied Discussion posts, found linked in our sidebar. You should use search engines and personally contact businesses before asking basic questions. If a question's answer is found through a quick search, it may be removed. 

###Rule #6 - Site-Wide Rules

Abide by Reddit's content policy, [found here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). This means no referral links, crowdfunding campaigns, unsanctioned promotion of any kind, surveys, petitions, and buy/sell posts. This can also include content that leads to or promotes off-site witch-hunting.

We remove certain low-quality domains as well as affiliate links and URLs with UTM parameters. You are welcome to resubmit with alternative links if needed.

**About Missouri**  
Missouri is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. Ranking 21st in land area, and 19th in population, it has 6 million residents. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.

Humans have inhabited what is now Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. When European explorers arrived in the 17th century, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Many from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland.

Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.

Missouri's culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond. Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks and Branson.

Well-known Missourians include Chuck Berry, Sheryl Crow, Walt Disney, Edwin Hubble, Nelly, Brad Pitt, Harry S. Truman, and Mark Twain. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis. Missouri has been called the ""Mother of the West"", the ""Cave State"", and the ""Show Me State""."

Please **do not** solicit psychological, psychiatric, or medical advice. It is unethical for professionals to respond to such inquiries, and those not qualified shouldn't respond anyway.

#Submission Guidelines

* Submissions need to cite at least one peer-reviewed study. We understand that not all of our members are involved in academia, but submissions should primarily come from journal articles and sourced and long-form articles.

* If your submission is a video that references peer-reviewed research, please comment in the thread with links to the research. Video submissions without such a comment will be removed.

* All link posts should have titles that clearly tell the reader what the content is. All posts with clickbait titles, titles that explain nothing about what is in the link, severely editorialized titles, or titles that attempt to promote an agenda will be removed.

* Images, GIFs, jokes, and content discussing philosophy, religion, and pseudoscience (except when in the context of a study) are not appropriate and will be removed.

* Links to self-help, blogspam, “guru” websites, or other unsourced material are not appropriate and will be removed.

* We encourage users to make an initial comment in their submission thread.  Perhaps why you found the content interesting or troubling, a critique of a study's methods, etc.

* Please do not post links to your own surveys.  If you require participants for a survey, try /r/samplesize or our [survey thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/3dw9q7/psychological_surveysresearch_thread/).

- If you would like to talk about careers in psychology, try /r/academicpsychology

- If you need advice, try /r/advice


#Comment Guidelines

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) applies.  Please be civil. Name-calling, ad hominems, racism, sexism, etc, will not be tolerated. Malicious abusers and/or continued abuse will lead to a ban.

* Comments (especially top-level) consisting solely of anecdotes, jokes, memes, or otherwise off-topic remarks will be removed.  Your comment is likely to be removed if it's evident you have not read the submission.

* We welcome opposing views and perspectives, but comments meant to intentionally deride, mock, or cause harm will be removed.

* No dismissive or anti-science comments. Comments mocking or belittling the field will be removed.  If you are concerned about a study's methodology, please elaborate as to why, and not just leave ""This is common sense!"" or ""Well, duh!"" posts.

----

* If you submitted a link and it doesn't appear in the ""new"" queue, please ensure that your post conforms to the submission guidelines. If your post conforms to the submission guidelines and was still removed, please link to the post in question and why you think we should re-approve the submission.

######COMMON QUESTIONS

1. Soreness does not indicate training effect.  
You feel sore because you've performed an unfamiliar movement.  

2. You need progressive increases in resistance to progress. Doing the same routine for ten years without change will only make you better at doing that routine, at that intensity.  

3. If you're just starting out and want a good routine, here are some suggestions:

**The Bees Reddit**

**Bees** - flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, and are known for their role in pollination and for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families, though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.

Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae.

#***Please follow our posting guidelines:***

**#1** - [Must be related to Minnesota](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): All posts must relate to Minnesota in some way.

**#2** - [Personal Attacks](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): All users must behave respectfully towards other users. We gladly encourage all forms of argument or debate here in /r/minnesota, but when the discussion turns to attacking a person's character and not the ideas itself, you risk moderator action.

**#3** - [Discrimination](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): Posts that use any of the following characteristics of an individual/group as an explanation for behavior will not be tolerated.

* Race

* Religion/Belief System

* Nationality/Ancestry

* Sexual Orientation/Gender

* Ability/Disability Status

Merely discussing such topics is not discriminatory.

Saying that all [these] people are [this] because they are [that] is.

Moderators will use our best discretion, but if you think it's discriminatory, it probably is, and you should re-think your post.

**#4** - [Craigslist-Like Posts](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): This is not the place to buy/sell/trade/crowdfund/hire, so please use one of the following subreddits: 
**r/MNJobs | r/GoFundMe**

**#5** - [Adult Content](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): Content that contains nudity, pornography, or excessive profanity, which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a public or formal setting such as in a workplace should not be posted.

**#6** - [Trolling](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): Please don't come here just to annoy people.

**#7** - [Major Changes to Already Titled Work](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): When submitting a link to an already titled work, users must use its original title, a properly punctuated quote from the article in addition to its original title, or properly punctuated bracketed paraphrasing or commentary in addition to its original title

This rule is strictly enforced when reporting the news.

**#8** - [No misinformation or unsubstantiated rumors](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): Verifiably false information is prohibited. This includes claims with links that do not support said claims.

Rumors of important changes and events (such as government policy changes, upcoming actions of public figures or entities, etc.) must originate from a reputable source, such as news media or established reporters.

**#9** - [Duplicates / Reposts](/r/minnesota/about/rules/): When submitting new content, please be sure it hasn't already been posted before or a long enough period has passed before reposting. This rule also covers cases in which a post is not identical to another, but covers the same story, event, or opinion without substantially differing information.

**#10** - [Follow Site-Wide Rules & Reddiquette](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy): While we are less likely to enforce every reddiquette rule, we highly encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with both [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439)."

### Any post promoting a company, service, or product is removed, and poster will be banned for life. 

*From the wiki* : Information graphics or infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics present complex information quickly and clearly, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. With an information graphic, computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians develop and communicate concepts using a single symbol to process information.

[Example of an infographic using visuals to convey information in a way text could not](http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12-16-14.gif)

**Do not post**:
Brochures, flyers, posters, graphic images with swaths of text laid over them, three page long images that simply add costs (cost of batman, cost of love, etc)

**Spam and Promotion**

Any post that is promoting a single company, product, or service will be removed, and the poster banned. These are considered thinly veiled ads and are spammy. Moderator discretion will be used to judge whether a post falls within this category.

* **What is good:** Anything that fosters discussion and can help people to see a different perspective.

729,hagerstown,"Hagerstown, MD","Beautiful city tucked in between Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Small town charm, excellent eateries, world class shopping.","**Hagerstown, MD:** 

Hagerstown was founded in 1762 by Jonathan Hager, a gunsmith, fur trader, farmer and politician. After settling he quickly increased his wealth and expanded his land holdings acquiring over 10,000 acres which he used to lay out plans for the town. It was originally named Elizabethtowne, in honor of his wife, but was later changed to Hagerstown in his honor.

Hagerstown was situated at the crossroads of the “Warrior Trading Path,” the Eastern Native American North / South Trading Route, which is modern day Route 11 and the First National Road, now Route 40. The town grew quickly and was a prized location for transportation of all kinds from covered wagon to nearby river navigation.

The nickname *“Hub City”* comes from the way all the railroad lines running into Hagerstown resembled the spokes of a wagon wheel on a map.

733,Thewarondrugs,The War On Drugs - Time For A New Drug Policy,,"***

 **Welcome to The War On Drugs** 

----





----



The UN was presented with a report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy, stating the war on drugs was a failure. Which makes now the time to open the legalization discussion to include cannabis and the other illicit drugs and how different drugs would  need to be regulated for a humane and functional society.
 
We need to stop the harm that is being wrought by prohibition, by legalizing, taxing and controlling drugs. It is time to move away from the current drug policies which are leaving drug sales and their huge profits to the criminals, cartels and the black market.

###You banned me!

We routinely ban people who post things that are obviously spam and/or very much outside what the subscribers of this subreddit want.

If you've been banned, it means you looked like a spammer, or you looked like someone who didn't look at what's been posted before posting something very much unwanted here.

So if you made a mistake, please send a short note explaining this to the mods and we'll probably unban you. If you're not sure why your content got you banned, it may mean that we're not confident you won't post something like that in future, and we may retain the ban simply to prevent you from posting such things again. It's not personal.

We will also ban troublemakers and people who are egregiously rude. At our discretion."

742,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,This Is Not A Safe Space,We're not a safe space.,"r/ThisIsNotASafeSpace is a moderated community intended to foster discussion for those opposed to the surge in unabated intersectional identitarian activism, lead by misguided activists and postmodern academics, in the name of ending perceived social injustice. We specifically oppose those movements which utilize totalitarian tactics to gain control of spaces and hinder free expression, while promoting ideologies aimed at increasing divisiveness and polarization.

This might be the place for you if you believe that:

- The best counter to hate speech is more speech, because sunlight is the best disinfectant.
- People should not blindly bend to the demands of activists without proper cause or discourse, out of fear of facing repercussions from a mob whose goal is to publicly shame them.
- Labeling and dividing people into social classes based on perceived privilege is a form of segregation, and has the opposite intended effect, creating more bigots in its march to end bigotry.
- Equity breeds contempt, and cannot solve the problem of hatred, but equal opportunities are paramount to eliminating hate and bigotry.

---

###RULES

1. **Participate in good faith.** Your discussions should be kept civil. Trolling, picking ""gotcha"" fights, or trying to soapbox to spread hate will get you banned. Additionally, comments or posts which promote actual, malignant bigotry (that is, intent to disparage groups of people based on race, ethnicity, sex/gender, orientation, or religion, including by use of slurs) or advocate for harm or violence, are subject to removal. 

2. **Posts should be related to identity politics, cancel culture, political correctness, social justice activism, critical theory, and discussion around those issues.** Moderators may approve other topics at their sole discretion. Memes and shitposts are only allowed on Shitpost Saturdays.

3. **Do not interfere with other subreddits.** Content originating from other subreddits (be they comments or posts) must be in the form of a screenshot with all usernames redacted. Direct links to other subs (including archive links) are not permitted.

4. **Don't spam or repost.** Don't post your own content exclusively; this sub is not an advertising platform. And don't post content that's been previously posted in the last month. Repetition is unnecessary."

Please do not down-vote the posting of famous figures because you dislike the famous figure (unless you feel the person is too insignificant to appear in the list), since both good and evil personalities who affected the world will be documented.  It is suggested that if you dislike the famous (or perhaps infamous) person, then provide a comment linking to or discussing their shortcomings.

750,awakened,A place to explore spiritual awakening,"Awakening is the realization that far more can be found in direct experience than any concept, belief system, or narrative. The process of awakening is an ever-unfolding one, a deepening of that which is beyond all words and thoughts. We are in service of discovering that for ourselves.","## What is Awakening?

Awakening is the realization that far more can be found in direct experience than any concept, belief system, or narrative. The process of awakening is an ever-unfolding one, a deepening of that which is beyond all words and thoughts. We are in service of discovering that for ourselves.

## [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/wiki/faq)

## Posting Rules

This is a place for sincere discussion first and foremost:

- Please be civil.
- No spam.
- Please stay on topic.
- Videos, images or otherwise memetic content should include an anecdote (your thoughts on why you find it relevant, a particular quote you like, etc.) 
-Title posts with no content may be removed at the discretion of the mods.
- Videos with no anecdotes should be posted in our sister sub, r/AwakenedTV
- If you infrequently link to a specific _personal_ video, blog post, or audio that is exploring your own process rather than promoting a brand or platform, these may be permitted at the moderators' discretion. 

[Click here to see the full set of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/about/rules/)

## Guidelines

When posting, please try to keep these things in mind: 

- Posts should be about spiritual awakening: the direct experience of what we really are
- Self-honesty is critical on the path. As such, take care to (i) only provide insights or guidance from your direct experience of awakening, and (ii) not to speak in such a way that indicates a level of spiritual maturity that is not reflective of your actual direct experience (this can significantly impede your own development and maybe that of others).
- When giving advice, look to meet people where they are, consider: what is the very next thing this person needs to hear (based on their current development), rather than a one-size fits all answer.
- You will benefit far more from asking sincere questions than providing insights or guidance that is not reflective of your actual direct experience. As such, questions are encouraged: be sincere and ask what is most relevant to you right now.
- Please follow the rules.

## Slack Community 

The community also has an unofficial (i.e., not moderated by us) [Slack](http://r-awakened.slack.com) channel for asynchronous chat with free mobile and desktop apps.

751,pranks,Pranks : A Catalog of Great Pranks,"The best collection of great, original pranks online.","Welcome to /r/Pranks! 

###Rules

*Over all: Your post must contain an original, funny and harmless prank.*

1. Do not solicit ideas for pranks. 

2. Only original content from the original source is allowed.

3. Do not post pranks which were recorded in locations you do not have permission to record.

4. Provide a clear and descriptive title! Clickbait titles (e.g. ""EPIC PRANK,"" ""BEST PRANK EVER,"" etc.) are not allowed.

5. Harmless pranks only. No pranks that include destructive, dangerous, harassing or illegal behavior.

6. No personal attacks on others.

7. Do not post personal information. This includes phone numbers, full names, email addresses, social media profiles and websites that link to the personal info of others."

####Check the news for ""Florida Man"" to keep us up to date on his latest misadventures!

Please keep in mind that this sub is intended to be funny.  ""Florida Man Decapitates Baby"" is not funny.  We're looking for more of a ""Naked Florida Man, High on Meth, Tries to Rob Liquor Store with a Dead Stingray"" kind of vibe.

Submissions from satire sites are cheating and will be removed.

759,socialwork,A Spot for Social Workers...,"This community is for social workers and those interested in joining the social work field! It is a place to ask for advice, share your frustrations, receive support, and anything else related to the social work sector.","**Posting Guidelines:**
-

Please:

- Search for similar questions before asking yours
- Be concise in your post title
- Be kind, keep discussions civil, and practice good [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

**Rules/Posts subject to removal:**
-

1. **This subreddit is not intended for professional advice including: medical, legal, mental health and financial advice**. All client-seeking advice questions will be removed. This is place for professional feedback and development. This subreddit is intended for social work professionals and students to serve as a place discuss the field itself.  Posters answering obvious posts asking for professional advice, will receive a warning for their first offense and a temporary 5 day ban for subsequent offenses.

2. No questions about school and/or entering the field of social work. This sub receives plethora of posts related to social work education, admissions, internships, and how to become a social worker. If you have a question that is related to social work education or entering the field, please post it in the ""Weekly School of Social Work/New to Social Work Thread"" pinned to the top of the main page.

3. No blog posts or self-promotional posts. This includes links to your practices/businesses, YouTube pages, etsy stores, etc.

4. Questions related to licensure will be removed.  Obtaining your license is something that can vary from state to state and can be very nuanced. We do not want anyone to be given potentially wrong advice when it comes to their career (this has happened on this board). Always contact the your licensing board.  Supervisors and coworkers may be another good resource as well as they should be familiar with the process.

5. Posts asking about salary will be removed. All salary posts will be redirected to our Salary megathread (linked in the sidebar).

6. No asking/looking for jobs, job postings, job availability, the job market in certain cities, or resume help. There are many other subs that are dedicated to these topics, please consult with them for these questions. We do allow city/state-specific job market questions in our stickied thread.

7. No asking for help with your homework assignments, evaluations, or interviewing a social worker. Homework in all of its stages is meant to help develop you as a professional.  If you are feeling stuck, please consult with either your professor, supervisor, or classmates for assistance.  They will be much more familiar with the criteria of the assignment than us.

8. No solicitation posts. This means no posts asking for financial assistance, no links to GoFundMe campaigns, no posts asking for or propositioning an exchange of money.

9. We want this subreddit to be a place for social workers to be able to get feedback from peers, but we also must be mindful that posts are protecting the identity of the client. Posts may be removed temporarily at the discretion of the moderators if there are confidentiality concerns and the poster will be given the option to edit the post to make it less identifiable before being reapproved.

10. No crossposting out of the subreddit. If you find a post fits into another subreddit, please copy/paste into a new post (and give credit to the original author). [This post](https://reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/rhw5l8/update_to_rules_no_crossposting/) explains the reasoning for this rule.

**Weekly Themed Threads**

Sunday - Education/New to SW

Monday - Underground Discussion

Tuesday - Link to Salary Thread

Wednesday - Venting/Rant Thread

Thursday - Leaving the field thread

Friday - Positivity/Sharing Wins

*If your post is more appropriate for one of the weekly threads, you'll be redirected to there*

- If you are uncertain if your post will break one of the sub's rules, please message the moderators and tell us the content of your post and we will let you know.  We are very friendly and do not bite. :)

***

We only allow research that is specifically targeting social workers and has been approved by an IRB to be posted here. If you are a researcher and want to post your survey here, please send us a modmail before posting.

**If you are writing a book/screenplay and would like feedback on the accuracy of events involving a social worker, you must send a modmail before posting. Book/screenplay feedback posts that haven't reached out to mods ahead of time will be removed.**

760,Conservatives_R_Us,Where conservatives win with wit,A place to for conservatives of all nations to discuss politics and articles related to or of interest to conservatives.,"All kinds of conservatives are welcome.

The goal here is to keep things insightful and non-confrontational.

We do not tolerate racism, sexism, or hate in general.

We are not a forum for liberals to come and do battle with conservatives.  If you are going to troll, expect to be banned.  We *will* be okay with respectful banter.  


For a good mission statement see [The Speech.](http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html)






 - Pro Second Amendment.  ""Shall not be infringed"" is clear.
 
 - Slow gradual progress is preferable to radical change
 
 - Not ALL change is good change.

 - We must preserve those institutions worth preserving


 - Small governments that defer to local governments whenever possible are preferable .

 - Government's principal responsibility is to protect the lives and rights of its constituents as laid out in the Constitution.

 - Milton Friedman/Chicago School economics.

 - Promoting Democracy throughout the world.

 - Strong military...funded military.
 
 - Lower taxes on the American people.  If taxes are raised, let's make everyone have some skin in the game.

 - Less crippling regulations on job creators.


You MAY editorialize your titles to reflect the content of the article or to draw attention to the important part/s.  You may NOT choose a title that misleads and doesn't reflect the content of the article.

 - Please have a look at the subreddit to make sure your submission doesn't have a variant of it already submitted.

***Regarding submissions from blogs:  If the blog is merely a reiteration of a news story, please locate the news story from a non-blog source and post IT instead of the blog.  We understand that some blogs have links that put a number of relevant stories together around a topic.  We don't want to become like other subreddits , where a topic is flogged to death by endless blog posts that don't add anything to the story.***

Please don't complain about people's submissions.  If you don't like them, don't upvote them.  There may be subs about entertainment, or world affairs.  If it doesn't belong here, the mods will decide.  If it's harmless and interesting, it will likely stay.  Don't report and tell us that the site is ""biased"".  We know.  That's the point.  We see the content that gets launched onto the front page of /r/politics written by the 16 year-old foaming-at-the-mouth-liberal who thinks that ""Repuglicons"" are evil and should be exiled from the USA... or the dude that hasn't gotten over #occupy and lives on Hot Pockets fighting people online who don't like Bernie Sanders.

What we want is good, convivial discourse.

765,conservatives,conservatives,"Conservatism (from conservare, ""to preserve"") is a political and social philosophy that promotes the maintenance of traditional institutions and supports minimal and gradual change in society.","Conservatism (from, conservare, ""to preserve"") is a political and social philosophy that promotes the maintenance of traditional institutions and supports minimal and gradual change in society.  Conservatives will also argue for reversal of change that has proven to be detrimental.

*****

Feel free to speak your mind, as a conservative, without fear of being banned.  Non-conservatives may ask questions and engage in polite conversation with conservatives on a limited basis, but should avoid heated debate or downvoting our users based on opinion.   

This is not, in fact, a debate subreddit... so if you are a liberal you are not welcome to constantly try to challenge conservatives here.  There are other subreddits where you may do that.

 Please do not use excessive profanity and heated rhetoric.
*****


*****

Rules:

1) Personal Attacks

Avoid personal attacks and insults. Be civil at all times. Spirited discussion and disagreement is encouraged, but insults and personal attacks degrade the quality of discussion on the subreddit and will not be tolerated.

2) Bigotry

You may not make racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or otherwise bigoted comments in the sub.

3) Reddiquete

Follow reddit [terms of service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) and [Reddiquette](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)

4) Voting and Complaints of Bias

Do not engage in blind downvoting of comments and submissions on a partisan basis. Do not complain that articles are biased.

5)  Liberal Talking Points

Do not make comments consisting entirely of liberal talking points. For example: Do not make the case for socialism, universal health care or UBI. Do not use the subreddit to shill for liberal candidates/politicians.

6) Conservative Bashing

There are a lot of places on reddit where bashing Conservatism is allowed and even encouraged. This is not one of them.

7) Trolling

Do not engage in trollish behavior. Avoid excessive profanity.

8)  Use Your Words

Posts and comments consisting of one word, an image, meme or just an emoji are highly discouraged as we seek to foster debate and conversation. As such, they are subject to removal at the mods' discretion.

9) Complaints About Benign Submissions

Do not complain in the comment section about submissions that are benign in nature. If there is something posted that is truly inappropriate, message the moderators or hit the report button.

10) Complaints About the Subreddit

Complaints about the subreddit should be directed to [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/conservatives)

11) Posts and comments about transgenderism

Posts and comments about transgender individuals, news stories referencing them, any sexualization or mutilation of children by individuals who identify as part of this group, or governmental or institutional policies about them will no longer be allowed on this subreddit, because certain redditors consider anything remotely negative posted about that group to be ""promoting hate"", and the admins agree with them.  Any such posts or comments should be taken to a different platform on which free speech is still possible.




  

[If you are a liberal joining us](https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/wiki/newliberals).  

If you have issues with anyone violating the rules, please message the moderators.  Thank you.

##Rules:

**1)** **NO** violations of [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/) - anyone doing this will be banned without warning

**2)** Are you a patient or someone else who wants to voice their complaint about your local pharmacy? This is not the correct place for it. Please direct those posts to /r/TalesFromTheCustomer.  

**3)** If you have a specific question then those are more suited for /r/Pharmacy than here.  If posting there then get straight to the question without too much unneeded information.  Any posts containing either of these will be removed.

**4)** Images are okay but an accompanying story must appear      in the comments

**5)** Anything read here should not be taken as any type of medical advice. If you are searching for specific medical advice then Reddit is not the place to look for it.  Please direct yourself to a medical professional such as your local pharmacist, doctor, or provider.  

**6)** Questions regarding Pharmacy Technicians can also be found in /r/PharmacyTechnician

**7)** If it isn't a tale then it doesn't belong here and will be removed

We have detailed how to fix a common highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1ejx7t/highlighted_comments_hard_to_read/ca1nx3r), and a more recent highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1m1b3l/does_anyone_really_think_that_this_is_a_good/cc5kyxx).  RES users may benefit from switching to NIGHT-MODE too.  If you would prefer not to use our custom theme, you can disable custom themes globally in your reddit preferences (just untick ""allow subreddits to show me custom styles"" in the ""display options"" section), or locally by de-selecting 'Use subreddit style' at the top of this sidebar."

> # Our Mission
KotakuInAction is a platform for open discussion of the issues where gaming, nerd culture, the Internet, and media collide.

>We believe that the current standards of ethics in the media have alienated the artists, developers, and creators who perpetuate the things we love, enjoy, and enthusiastically build communities around. We have observed numerous incidents involving conflicts of interest and agenda-pushing within media which we feel are damaging to the credibility of the medium and harm the community at large. We believe much of the current media is complicit in the proliferation of an ideology that squashes individuality, divides along political lines, and is stifling to the freedom of creativity that is the foundation of human expression.

>KotakuInAction is a community that condemns willful censorship, exclusion, harassment, and abuse. It is a community that organizes to hold the media accountable to the concept of artistic freedom by standing up for the artist, the developer, the writer, the filmmaker, and all who enjoy the freedom to create, explore, and expand. It is a community that allows the exchange of information, supports the ongoing discussion of media ethics, and protects the right of the individual to embrace their personal interests in entertainment and fandom.

>KotakuInAction is built around a core focus on reasonable, friendly discussion of the issues related to gaming culture, and those involved in it. That is not all we are about, but it's where we began and will remain our core.  We hold ourselves to be politically neutral ground, not forcing anyone to conform in their opinions, and permitting a wide variety of viewpoints to express themselves in a civil manner.

**GNU/Linux is a free and open source software operating system for computers.** The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it.

GNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Linux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones, and more. These can include things like Android or ChromeOS. GNU itself is also used without Linux, some examples appear in projects like Debian/kFreebsd and Guix GNU/Hurd.

#Rules#

[Please review full details on rules here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/about/rules/). All rules will be applied regardless of the number upvotes a post/comment has.

*   **No support requests** - This is not a support forum! Head to /r/linuxquestions or /r/linux4noobs for support or help. Looking for a distro? Try r/findmeadistro.

*    **No spamblog submissions** - Posts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Posts that are identified as either blog-spam, a link aggregator, or an otherwise low-effort website are to be removed. Some reasons for removal are that they contain re-hosted content, usually paired with privacy-invading ads. If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains

*   **No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes** - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in r/linux. Feel free to post over at /r/linuxmemes instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere.

*    **Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion** - r/linux asks all users follow [Reddiquette.](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not ""Remembering the human"" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed. See also: /r/linux/wiki/rules/userconduct

* **Relevance to r/linux community / Promoting closed source applications over FOSS** - Posts should follow what the community likes: GNU, Linux kernel, developers of open source software, or other applications on Linux. Take some time to get the feel of the subreddit if you're not sure!

*    **Spamming self-promotion, surveys, crowdfunding** - Submitting your own original content is welcome on r/linux, but we do ask that you contribute more than just your own content to the subreddit as well as require you to interact with the comments of your submission. We set that no more than 10% of your posts should be your content. Please be aware that this does not supersede other rules. Additionally, surveys for your blog/news source/paper/own use are not allowed. Please see /r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding for those crowdfunding..

*    **No misdirecting links, sites that require a login, or URL shorteners** - In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed in r/linux. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned. See a list here, although the mods will make a decision on a per domain basis as needed: /r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains

*    **No NSFW** - No NSFW links or images without mod approval. No discussion that is overly-suggestive to what is normally considered NSFW.

* **Non-useful Image Upload/Fluff Image** - Images of ""Linux in the wild"", plushies, Tux, and more are not encouraged for posting as a top level submission. If necessary, this can apply to comments too at mod discretion. The image/video upload feature is for posts regarding features/guides/etc. See also: Meme rule.

793,combinedgifs,gif+gif,A subreddit for gifs put together in a relevant manner.,"A subreddit for combined gifs.

**Rules:**

1. You may only post combined gifs. Side by side gifs are allowed. Sequentially combined gifs (one after the other) are allowed.

2. Submit similar combined gifs in moderation (e.g. the Force push gifs). If there are many variations of the same combined gif please make an imgur album and link to that instead of each individual gif.

3. Combined gifs must be relevant to each other.

4. Submissions don't necessarily have to be funny, as long as the two gifs are relevant to each other.

5. Please link directly to the gif - no websites or videos. For blogs, reupload the gifs to imgur and leave a link to the blog in the comments. HTML5 files are allowed.

6. If your post is NSFW or NSFL, please include [NSFW] or [NSFL] in the title. We have tags, but users from /r/all may not see them.

---

##**Troubleshooting**

**If you CANNOT SEE ANY NSFW POSTS**

Change your account settings to enable NSFW content [by clicking here.](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/) 

Tick the 'I'm over 18 years old.....' box ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/qAPtyKeh.jpg)) and **SAVE** those settings.

---

##**When to upvote**

If the ***title of a post*** gives you a ***compelling choice, upvote!*** 

Compelling choice means that **one option encourages you to click and the other option discourage you from clicking**. Don't just upvote because you liked the actual outcome. 

---

##**What is Original5050?**

An Original5050 post provides two possibilities in the title with only one actual result. Since you don't know which you'll get until you click the link, you have a 50/50 chance of getting one or the other. When the sub first started, this was the only way to make 5050 posts. You can submit an Original5050 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).

##**What is True5050?**
 A True5050 post has two options in the title with two possible results. It will randomly pick and give users one of the two options. These posts are given a **[TRUE]** flair. Use [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) to create a True5050 post. 

**View Only True5050 Posts**

If you only want to browse True5050 posts, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiftyfifty/search?q=flair%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). This will filter out all Original5050 posts for you.

**Submit a True5050 post** 

Go to [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) and enter both options there. The site will generate a link, which will randomly switch between both outcomes. Submit this link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/submit).

---

##**Rules for Comments**

**DO NOT** link the outcomes of any posts in the comments. Users that do so ***will be BANNED.*** This applies to True5050 and Original5050 posts equally. Asking for links/DMs is also banworthy. 

----

##**Rules for Submissions**

**I. Title Formatting (Good option | Bad option)**

>Your title has to start with [50/50], have two clear options in your title (one must be good and one must be bad), and include either ""NSFL"", ""NSFW"" or ""SFW"". 

>Formatting example: [50/50] Bouncing boobies (NSFW) | Man Disembowelled in Pool (NSFL)

>**One option should encourage people to click and the other option should discourage them from clicking.**

 >If an option is just neutral or boring, the submission will be removed.



 **II. Only Use Approved Image Domains**

>Post have to be hosted on [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Giphy](http://giphy.com), [Postimage](http://postimage.org), [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com), [Minus](http://minus.com), [YouTube](http://youtube.com), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), [Liveleak](http://liveleak.com), [5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk), [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com) or directly on /r/FiftyFifty. 

**III. No Illegal Content**

>The following options are examples of content that is **NOT PERMITTED**, *even if they are the made-up option*:

>* Depictions of Murder or Torture 

>* Depictions of Suicide / Intentional Self-Harm

>* Sexual Violence

>* Animal Cruelty

>* Dead or Injured Children

**IV. Descriptive, Distinct & Clear Options**

>If users click your link, they get either the first or the second option. Both options have to be descriptive, distinct & clear. Posts where both options are the same word(s) will result in bans, especially when the words are body parts. 

>* **Descriptive:** It's not necessary to interpret your title. Before clicking the link, users know **exactly** what 2 options they can expect. Do not insert your opinions about the content in the title. 

>* **Clear:** It's not possible to confuse the 2 options. **Instantly** after clicking the link, it's clear which option the users got  - without relying on context (like video titles or 18+ warnings).

**V. True5050 for Porn, Cute Animals & Spoilers**

>The following options **MUST be in True5050 form** ([5050.stannaz](https://5050.stannaz.uk) or [5050.lowyiyiu](https://5050.lowyiyiu.com)), *even if it's only the made-up option*:

>* Porn (sexualized nudity, actions or body parts)
>* (Cute) Animals
>* Spoilers 

**VI. Other Forbidden 50/50s**

>* Memes or low effort posts (Rickrolls, Spongebob, Sonic, Shrek and cursed content are instant bans)
>* [Self-Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (Instant perm ban)
>* Fake or hacked nudes
>* Trans, gay, or male porn presented as the bad option. 
>* Loud noises / Jump scares
>* Music / Opinions
>* Animals that sound like body parts
>* Villains as the Good Option (like Hitler) 

**VII. Moderator discretion**

>Mods reserve the right to remove any offending post or comment *at their own discretion*. Bans may also apply. The rules above are not exhaustive. 

You may appeal any mod action taken against you, but you're not entitled to a response.

###[VERIFY HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmilf&subject=Verification%20Request)

##Verification

* **NOTE:  New and/or low-karma accounts CANNOT be verified. If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a month or so before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.**

* **NOTE: We DO NOT verify male-run or shared accounts.**

* **WE DO NOT VERIFY CENSORED/MILD/NON-NUDE ACCOUNTS! If you to submit only censored/mild/non-nude content, you cannot be verified here. You will have much better luck in /r/gonemild. Accounts that become verified and later post only/mostly censored/mild/non-nude content will risk losing verification.**

* Individuals posting **OC** are required to submit verification and prove you're the one in the photos. Consent is a critical part of the overall health of this community.

* Submit Verification by clicking the **VERIFY HERE TAB** above and get flair! **[Read all about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

* Include your username, the date, and a mention of /r/milf. **Crumple the paper into a ball, and straighten it back out**. Take at least 3 NUDE color pictures of yourself holding the sign, from 3 different angles. Upload the images to catbox.moe, lensdump.com, or redgifs.com and then send us the link in a modmail message. **DO NOT UPLOAD THEM TO IMGUR.COM, THEY NO LONGER ALLOW NSFW CONTENT!!**. **DO NOT** use Photoshop or any filters.

* Private messages from users asking for verification pictures? Gross, spammy or harassing PM's? Clicking the 'block' link helps bring it to the Reddit admin's attention. Then message the mods and let us know.

804,AnybodyButHillary,,,
805,oddlysatisfying,Oddly Satisfying,For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.,"###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does ""Oddly Satisfying"" mean?
We are forever searching for a ""true definition"". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* ""oddly satisfying"" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as ""2048"", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.

* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. 

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (""Say it, don't show it.""). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as ""My..."", ""Mine..."", ""Our..."", ""We..."", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing & ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments & Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is ""Oddly Satisfying"" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

Buttcoin is a peer-to-peer butt. Peer-to-peer means that no central authority issues new butts or tracks butts. These tasks are managed collectively by the network. It’s like a bitcoin, but with butts instead.

Civil, On-topic Discussion of Anarcho-Capitalism and other Libertarian Topics.


NOTE: Only MEMBERS may comment. See sidebar for more info.","MEMBERS ONLY - Civil, on-topic discussion of anarcho-capitalism and other libertarian topics.

Libertarianism is a philosophy that holds that one should not initiate aggression on person or property. Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy that advocates for the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and free market production of law and justice. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of a state or ruler, society would improve itself through empowering individual choice and the discipline of the free market, or what its proponents describe as a voluntary society.

Racism and Social Justice are considered off-topic here; libertarianism does not have a racial component. All posts related to racism and social justice must have some obvious link to libertarianism and may be removed at moderator discretion.

**What is TRON?**

---

TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet. The Tron Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability and high-throughput support that underlies all the decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem.

**Decentralized applications that you can trust:**

We strive to create a decentralized internet that allows everyone to freely create content, websites, and applications, without relying on centralized services. By empowering the users, we will transform the internet on a global scale.

**Blockchain-based smart contracts:**

In the new internet era, the legislative power will be transferred from an opaque centralized authority to transparent codes. Rules and platforms will be entirely transparent and based on faithfully executed smart contracts.

**Digital Assets Issued by Anyone:**

Blockchain technology allows every individual the ability to issue digital assets under the protection of a decentralized internet. Digital assets allow strangers to collaborate and profit on a grand scale, which is the foundation of a prosperous decentralized internet.

Tron is a representative of the Web 4.0 Ecosystem. More than 100,000 users from more than 100 countries have become part of this network with ever expanding boundaries.

TRON Protocol and the TVM allow anyone to develop DAPPs for themselves or their communities, with smart contracts making decentralized crowdfunding and token issuance easier than ever. Tron DAPP projects already include Bittorrent & Peiwo with 100M+ active users from more than 100 countries and regions around the world.

###RULES 
(along with normal [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette))

Don't forget to read our [**RULES PAGE**](/r/crypto/about/rules/)! The rules listed there are also used as this sub's report reasons. The quick version;

* Assume good faith and be kind. This is a friendly subreddit. 
* Codes, simple ciphers, ARGs, and other such ""weak crypto"" don't belong here. (Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto.) You're probably looking for /r/codes.
* Do not ask people to break your cryptosystem without first sharing the algorithm. [Sharing just the output is like...](/r/crypto/comments/1boxkg/-/c98x4ej)
* ""Crack this cipher"" challenges also belong in /r/codes *unless* they're based on interesting crypto implementation bugs, e.g. weak RSA keys.
* Familiarize yourself with the following before posting a question about a novel cryptosystem, or else the risk is nobody will take their time to answer: 
  * [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)
  * [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)
* Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions or challenges! You're expected to solve such problems yourself. You may ask for help to understand it, but you should disclose the source. 
* Systems that *use* crypto are not necessarily relevant here, e.g. Bitcoin. Maybe try /r/cryptocurrency? Political news also very rarely belong here. See the list of related subs below for alternatives. Remember that this sub is focused on the algorithms, and isn't political.

834,LifeProTips,Life Pro Tips,Tips that improve your life in one way or another.,"**What is a Life Pro Tip?**

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.

**Keep in mind that giving someone advice is not the same as giving someone a LPT.** Advice is offering someone guidance or offering someone a recommendation.

Examples of advice:

 “Always be prepared to leave your employer because they are prepared to leave you.”

“A marriage proposal should not come as a big surprise, despite what you may have seen in the movies.”

**Keep in mind that an aphorism is not a LPT.**

An aphorism is a a short clever saying that is intended to express a general truth or a concise statement of a principle.

Examples of aphorisms:

""A barking dog never bites.""

""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""

""All stones are broken stones.""

**RULES:**

1. No rude, offensive, racist, homophobic, sexist, aggressive or hateful posts/comments.

No bots, novelty accounts or impersonation|Bots and accounts made for a specific purpose will be banned unless a prior arrangement has been made with the mods. NB: This does not include throwaways. If you claim to be a prominent Kiwi, or are acting in any official capacity for a significant company, please message the mods with proof of your identity, or you run the risk of being banned.

Exceptions may be made for university projects with ethics approval, or for government / council open consultations. No advertising / promotion, affiliate URLs, or social media spam. Exceptions may be made for genuine subreddit engagement. You can request an exception by contacting the moderators. Failure to abide will result in removal and a potential ban for repeated offences.|
Engage in good faith|The moderators of r/NewZealand have the right to remove content that is deemed detrimental to the subreddit. This can include but is not limited to: trolling, low-effort submissions, COVID misinformation or intentionally skirting the rules.
No image posts that are political or low quality|Political memes and low-quality memes or image posts will be removed. This includes pictures of websites, newspapers, or video where the primary purpose is to share the content of an article. Pictures are permitted when highlighting something within the format, such as humorous article / ad placement. If the humour is subtle, please make a comment explaining it.
No contentious or low-effort selfposts| Hot-takes or contentious questions designed to provoke ire should not be posted. Serious and controversial topics should be discussed civilly & respectfully. Low effort questions such as ""where should I go visit"" or ""should I move to nz"" will be removed.

843,FemBoys,Femboys: Boys just wanna have fun,Unleash your feminine side! An 18+ subreddit for boys to get naughty.,"Welcome to /r/Femboys!
-
Pull up those thigh highs, get that butt plug and have some fun! Make sure to read the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemBoys/about/rules/) before posting!
---
# Rules

1. You must be 18+ to post and comment. Violations will result in an immediate ban. Any attempts to solicit content from minors will also be met with a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
2. Follow all global reddit rules. You can find these rules [here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).
3. No malicious activity. Do not intentionally harass, insult, or aggravate other users. Do not use slurs with malicious intent towards others. Racism, transphobia, homophobia, and all forms of bigotry are not tolerated here.
4. Only post photos or videos of yourself. All posts must be made by the person in the photo / video. If you are with a partner/s in your content, you must have their consent to post.

 Artwork is not allowed in this sub (even if it is OC).
5. 
Users must clearly be femboys/trans-women/femininely presenting. This is a place for femboys, trans-women, and femininely presenting people. Having some body hair doesn't automatically break this rule, but excessive body hair most likely will.
6. 
Watermarking should be done tastefully. Watermarking your media with your Reddit username is encouraged, but should be done tastefully (keeping it small, and not too distracting).

 Watermarks which are intended to drive traffic to an outside site (Onlyfans for example), are not allowed.
7. Do not attempt to monetize this community. Do not request, solicit, or offer payment for services here. This includes sugaring, findom, and OnlyFans links. Keep all that on your profile.
8. Do not ask for or refer to upvotes in your post title or comments. This also includes titles intended to bait inauthentic engagement. Do not offer or promise content in exchange for upvotes or comments. A list of examples can be [found on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemBoys/wiki/rules). **This is not an exhaustive list and posts may be removed at moderator discretion.**
9. Heavily edited content must include [Altered] in the post title, or have the Altered flair applied. Snapchat filters / heavy photoshopping of your appearance / faceapp / etc, must include [Altered] in the post title, or attach the Altered flair.
10. No hookups, posting of any contact information/location, or requesting DMs. This subreddit is not the place to find hookups. Contact information, locations, or requesting someone to DM you are not allowed in either posts or comments.

 Any ""DM me hentai/porn/etc"" type post will result in a ban.
11. Do not post or repost excessively. You are limited to posting once every 8 hours.

 While reposting is allowed, please don't repost the same photo / video within 7 days of the previous post.
12. Accounts that are less than 7 days old will not be able to post.
13. NSFW posts only. Posts are at the mods discretion. Any post deemed not NSFW will be removed.

 If you would like to post SFW content, try r/femboy, r/feminineboys, or r/crossdressing.

How to verify:

- Include the tag [Verification] in your title, along with a link to a selfie including your beautiful face and holding a sign (or written on your body) with your reddit username, the name of this subreddit and the date.  If you're using a sign, crumple the paper then unfold.  There will be a two-step verification for any pictures that do not pass processing.

___________________________________________________

Subreddit Rules:

**Do not post your username or group hashtag** in your post or comment. Do not hint at what it might be.  We absolutely do not allow any information like that in public for safety reasons.  There is no middle ground here, you must instruct users to PM you.  [Here is why](http://bit.ly/1cs5nlC)

**We are a judgement free zone**: we ask users to keep comments positive.  This isn't the place to oppress others with your morals.  If you think a post is not appropriate, use the report button.  

**Selling of services is absolutely prohibited here.**  Use the report button or modmail if you come across a seller; there are subreddits better suited for this kind of thing.  Users are here for free hugs!  

**Everyone is welcome to post once every twelve hours**. Removing old posts or using alternate usernames does not exempt you from this rule.  

**Users will not post on behalf of others**.   Don't post pictures of others either. This is super catfishy and creepy.  

**Don't message the OP if you don't fit their criteria**: There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

**Be ready to chat now**: Don't expect to post, go to sleep or take a flight and then come back later to a full inbox.  This is pretty selfish tbh and your post will be removed.  

**Groups:** you too may post once every twelve hours and make sure other group users don't post within twelve hours of your post.  Take care to ensure that your post isn't voted on by your users [as this is considered to be vote manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_vote_cheating_and_vote_manipulation.3F).  Your users are welcome and encouraged to comment though!  

___________________________________________________

How to create a post:

- When creating a post you are required to use the proper tags or the AutoModerator will automatically remove it.
- The title should start off with your age (must be 18+) and then the proper tag, you can pick from those listed below
- M Stands for Male. F stands for Female. R stands for Redditor (meaning any gender or unspecified) and T stands for Trans. Tag Examples: 22 [F4M], [M4F], [G4F], [M4M], [T4F], [T4M], [M4G], [F4R], [T4R].
- You can add something constructive after the gender tag. So your title should look something like ""20 [F4R] Outgoing young lady looking to talk to anyone.""
- Allowed tags: [META], [F4R], [F4M], [F4F], [F4T], [F4G], [M4F], [M4M], [M4R], [M4T], [M4G], [R4F], [R4M], [R4R], [R4T], [R4G], [T4M], [T4F], [T4R], [T4T], [T4G], [G4M], [G4F], [G4R], [G4T]

Spam posters will be banned.

Men posting without consent will be banned. 

Those participating in findom will be banned. 

Those participating in sugar baby activities will be banned.

Those participating in DDlg will be banned. 

Those only on reddit to promote their OF will be banned.

Please read our rules before posting :) ","#Welcome to r/BBW_Chubby!

&nbsp;

#**This is NOT a selling subreddit, please do not post about selling here :)  If your bio/profile lists venmo/cashapp/paypal usernames, or asks/begs for money, you will be banned.  If you are involved in findomme, you will be banned.  If you are a spam poster, you will be banned.  If you have ""I only talk on Onlyfans"" in your bio, you will be banned.**

&nbsp;

1) **Be respectful at all times.**

>This means be respectful of the women who post, the people who comment on those posts and the mods who run the subreddit. 

>This means no breeding/pregnancy comments (instant ban), no violent/aggressive sexual comments (instant ban), no asking to DM/snap/kik/text etc., no asking OP for her location/giving your location/talking about meeting, no demanding certain poses/pics, no insulting or attacking others, etc.

>Help keep the sub fun and safe - report anything that seems out of place!

&nbsp;


**2) Bigotry of any kind will not be tolerated**

>Fat-shaming, racism, misogyny and any other bigotry will not be tolerated.
This is a body-positive sub. Bigotry of any sort will result in an immediate ban.

>Other things that will result in an immediate ban are racism, misogyny (calling OP a slut/whore unless given consent to do so, etc.)

&nbsp;

**3) No posts of men or their genitalia, or classifieds posts.**

>Men posting photos of themselves, or their genitalia, or posting ""classifieds"", will be immediately banned.  No, trans women who haven't had bottom surgery are not men, don't report them.  They are WOMEN.

>Women posting photos that show men or their genitalia will be warned once, banned on the second offense..  


&nbsp;

**4) Post Guidelines**
>No Fishing Titles.  This includes, but is not limited to - asking if you're cute/beautiful/sexy, saying ""even though 3 people will see this"", saying ""thanks for sorting by new"", saying ""do you like bellies/thighs/breasts"" etc, saying ""my bf thinks I'm ugly, do you?""  You get the idea - no titles in which you're very obviously trying to get a specific response or reaction our of our users.

>Mild posts are allowed.  However, keep your mild posts to one every 24 hours.  As well, try not to make them ""selfies"".  This means try not to use the usual selfie angles, no ""duck lips"", etc.  As well, mild posts must follow all of our other post guidelines.

>Watermarks may only consist of your reddit username, not your OF name or any other social media name/link.

>While we encourage the women who post to be creative and post what they like, there are a few things we would like to see, and not see.  We WOULD like to see creative photos that aren't the same photo that has been posted to many other subs all at once.  

>We do not want to see close-ups of body parts (1/2 your body must be visible in every photo), blurry/low resolution pictures, touched up/edited/filtered photos, collages of photos, dark photos (all photos must be well lit), stickers (such as you would see on instagram, facebook or snapchat), screenshots, hardcore content, or overly censored content meant to drive people to your paid content. As well, please do not delete and repost your pics over and over again.  It leaves tons of dead posts in the sub, and is a ban-able offense.  

>As well, while we do not kink-shame here and welcome people who aren't vanilla, please keep your post content vanilla here.  No fetish, kink, or BDSM content of any kind is allowed - there are plenty of subs for such content, we're focused on softcore, vanilla photos of women here.  One issue we've been having lately is women posing in NSFW photos with stuffed animals.  Please do not do this here, this is not in any way appropriate.

>Show us your creativity, let's make this sub the standard for NSFW subs!

&nbsp;

**4a) Karma Requirements**

>You need 500 combined karma to post here - that is, karma from posts/comments/both.  You must accumulate this karma NATURALLY.  No posts asking for upvotes, and no using ""free karma"" subreddits.  If you're found to be using either of these methods to get your karma, you will be banned.

&nbsp;


**5) Regarding Men Posting/Couple's Accounts**
>Due to a lack of verification photos being sent, stemming from what I believe is a rise in men posting without consent, ALL posts must now come from a woman's own account.  

>This means no couples accounts and no men's accounts.  Either type of account will be banned, if they are found to be posting.

&nbsp;

**6) Regarding Art Posts**
>Art must follow these guidelines - it must be of high quality (no doodles, as an example), it must be of larger women, it must be vanilla (larger than normal endowment is okay), it must be credited if the art does not belong to you, and it must follow the rest of the rules of the sub in it's nature as well. 

>Try to avoid posting comics.

***RULES***
-

**ALL** rules in this sub are *single strike*. This isn't baseball, you break a rule, you're out. No exceptions, no retrial, gone, done, banned. Period, end of story.

If you think someone is breaking the rules, use the report button, *but be warned* if you use the report button to troll or complain about someone selling **ON THEIR PROFILE** and they aren't doing so **in this sub**, then *you* will be the one who's banned for abusing the report button. 

*RULES FOR POSTERS*
=

**1)** 18+ years of age only.

**2)** No kik, snap, instagram, onlyfans, selling, anything else related to selling, or allusions to these items *IN THIS SUB.* You **CAN** have these things in your profile, you cannot mention them in this sub, you cannot put any mention of them in titles, comments, or anything of the sort. If someone wants to see what you're selling they'll go to your profile to find it on their own.

**3)** Must be amateur and must be of **you**. No boyfriend pics, no professional shots, no pictures of your favorite pornstar, no asking who some picture you found on the internet may be. This is very simple: If **you** are not the person in the picture, don't post it here.

**4)** No begging for upvotes. This means none of the ""To the five guys that'll see this"" or ""I hope at least one of you likes this"" or ""Posts haven't been getting much attention lately"" and so on and so forth. No one likes these titles, it's low hanging fruit, just stop it.

**5)** *All* posters must be **verified** in order for their posts to be visible. See the sticky post for how to verify yourself. If you aren't verified and your post is removed *do not* send a message to the mods asking why your post was removed. This is a stupid question and you'll be banned for asking instead of reading the rules.

**6)** No offensive comments, trolling, or spam.

*RULES FOR SUBSCRIBERS*
=

**1)** 18+ years of age only.

**2)** Read and understand the *ALL the rules for posters and subscribers* before you report anything. You are not a moderator here. The rules are there to teach you when to report something. If there's something you don't like and it's not breaking the rules, just downvote and move on. Reporting a rule breaker gets *them* banned, being an asshole and abusing the report button gets *you* banned.

**3)** No offensive comments, trolling, or spam.

**4)** No posting or hinting at personal information. If you think you recognize someone, keep it to yourself!

**5)** If a poster chooses to remain semi-clothed that's their choice. Respect it. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the spam filter picks up good and relevant posts by mistake. If this happens to you, [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBigBoobsGW) and your post will be rescued."

**Be cautious of any unusual private messages containing a link offering to share ""private"" photos with you from unknown, new or unverified users.**

**DID SOMEONE FIND YOUR FACEBOOK? It's a joke/trick link. Don't give them more contact info. Report/block them!**

## Rules
- **/r/gonewild is for posting visibly nude photos of yourself.** Gonewild is a place for open-minded Adult Redditors to exchange their nude bodies for karma; showing it off in a comfortable environment without pressure. You may be required to submit verification and prove you're the one in the photos. Consent is a critical part of the overall health of this community.

- **Abusive, rude, or troll behavior is not permitted.** **Report any comments or threads you find abusive.** We check the reported queue often. If you come across a user being mean spirited or posting personal info, click the report link. When you argue with a troll, you are entering a competition to see who has more free time. You will lose, because you have a life and the troll does not. **Do not EVER respond to trolls. Instead, report them!**

- **No self-promotion or attempts to make a profit anywhere.** If you use nudity anywhere on the net to get gifts or money (panty selling, fetish items, cam shows, onlyfans, or anything similar) please refrain from posting here. We wish to remain separated from all money-making endeavors, so that Gonewild remains a purely exhibitionists subreddit where people post for absolutely no other reason than the thrill of it.

- **No asking for upvotes (directly or indirectly).** Vote manipulation violates Reddit site-wide rules as well as the rules of /r/gonewild.

- **Tag your post titles with the correct gender tag - [f], [m], [cd], [t], [?], [nb].** All people are welcome to post here, but you must use appropriate tags. Be respectful. Don't insult the ones brave enough to submit photos/videos. If you don't want to see dicks then don't open the ones with the [m] tag... it'll likely be dicks. Feel free to be creative and play with this tag. A [CD] (cross dresser) tag, [t] (transgender) tag, [nb] (non-binary) or simply a [?] are also admissible, with the understanding that if someone clicks on a [?] or [nb] they don't mind a surprise.

- **Do not feed the trolls.** When you argue with a troll, you are entering a competition to see who has more free time. You will lose, because you have a life and the troll does not. Do not EVER respond to trolls. Instead, report them!

- **No name guessing or attempts to identify someone.** Respect the anonymity of our users or be banned. If you link to another user's personal info/content outside Reddit--if you so much as try to guess a name--you will be shown the door.

- **No mentioning or pestering for off-site contact.** Do not post, comment, or otherwise suggest/hint at off-reddit contact (snapchat, kik, tumblr, twitter, IG, PornHub, wishlists, etc.) here or on your profile page.

- **Do not delete your verification post.** If you get verified here please leave your post up, so that users don't report ""This poster has the 'verified' flair but has deleted their verification post."" and you have to do it over again.

**If you sell** panties, fetish items, cam shows, suggest payment (Onlyfans, PayPal, Cash App, etc.), request gifts/have a wishlist or anything similar **ANYWHERE on the net** please refrain from posting here. We wish to remain separated from all money-making endeavors, so that Gonewild remains a purely exhibitionists' subreddit where people post for absolutely no other reason than the thrill of it.


We want to foster safe, mature, low-pressure environment for true exhibitionists that are out for nothing other than to show off their naked bodies. **We don't explicitly state everything that is and is not allowed, so please don't try to skirt the rules**. Thank you!

7) **SOCIAL MEDIA SPAMMING**. Please don't do it. If every post you make has requests to contact you on your Kik in either the link title or images themselves it defeats the purpose of this sub.

Toys must be Fantasy Style & Body Safe. Materials of toys are limited to: 100% Platinum/Addition Cure Silicone, Acrylic, Annealed Glass, Anodized Aluminum, Stainless Steel, Titanium, Properly Enameled Ceramic, and Wood that has been Properly Treated and Sealed.","A community built around the love for Bad Dragon sex toys!

[Click to view only Nudity Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadDragon/search?q=flair%3Anudity&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new)

Here are a few rules, hints and tips:

* Adults only. Anyone under 18 found on the subreddit will be immediately banned.

* You cannot post or comment on the subreddit if your account is less than 31 days old or you have negative karma. This is non-negotiable.

* If you want help finding the right toy, feel free to use gender tags in to your post. Alternatively, advise on how you plan on using the toy (vaginally, anally, etc.). This is only so our community can help YOU!

* Note - Gender tags are NOT and NEVER will be mandatory, anyone who pesters those who post for not doing so will be warned, then if ignored, given a ban to emphasise the point.

* Keep a friendly atmosphere, everyone is encouraged to share. If someone posts a personal picture, please don't be derogatory, abusive or shame them in any way. Unless a post is has the ""Lewd Comments Welcome (Nudity)"" flair, making lewd or begging comments on any post will result in a permanent ban from the sub.

* No spamming, harassing, or trolling.

* In Use & NSFW Content Restrictions - From now on, all NSFW content is limited to one post every 72 hours. This includes, but is not limited to, lingerie pictures, in use content (anal, vaginal, oral, and masturbators), and full or partial nudity. The consequences for breaking the posting restrictions will be a 30 day ban. Any posts made during the cool down period will be removed. If we feel anyone is trying to take advantage of perceived loopholes you could still be liable for a permanent ban. Deleting content to bypass the 72 hour cool down will also result in a permanent ban. Due to the inherently NSFW nature of this subreddit and the complexity of gender identity, the Mod Team feels that it is only fair to include all topless content as NSFW regardless of if you were born or identify as male, and your posts will be removed if you break the cool down. Ahegao content is strictly not allowed on the subreddit.

* We also now require the maker and model names of all toys present in any nudity content to be part of your post title. Posts with clickbait titles like “will it fit”, “I can’t believe it fit”, “want to see me take it” etc. are not allowed and haven’t been for a while as per our [Columns of Community](https://reddit.com/r/BadDragon/comments/lxsk1b/columns_of_our_community/) post. Posts not following title rules will be removed and you can repost them with an appropriate title. Repeatedly ignoring this will result in a ban.

* Advertising and Watermarks - We do not allow links to commercial or personal sites unless you have approval from the moderation team. We require all watermarks to include your reddit username (with u/ included) for user verification so that we can be sure that your content has not been stolen. Additionally you may claim one other username in your watermark that may or may not coincide to your online presence elsewhere. Please note this nickname should be consistent as your reddit username doesn’t change. Your secondary username should only change rarely if needed and should not vary from post to post.

* Do not post content that is not yours. Doing so could result in a ban. This does not apply to stock photos of toys you have purchased, or memes. Examples of unacceptable non-OC would be stealing porn or trying to pass off someone else's collection photo as your own. Situations like that will result in a permanent ban.

* If you think it might be illegal (or it definitely IS illegal), don't post it. If you see illegal content, report it to the mods. Any profile containing illegal content or admission of illegal activity may be subject to a permanent ban at moderator discretion. This applies to fan art and especially to animal abuse for which we have a zero tolerance policy.  

* If you make a Buy/Sell/Trade post, any items you're wanting to sell/trade MUST have properly timestamped photos [(EXAMPLE)](http://i.imgur.com/pcaesHk.jpg) providing proof of ownership. This is for buyer safety. Failure to provide properly timestamped pictures will result in your post being removed for the infraction and a warning. You will then be free to repost the sale thread according to the rules. Further infractions may lead to a ban. [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadDragon/comments/i3x8y1/buying_trading_and_selling_safety_and_rules_30/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is a WONDERFUL post detailing the many ways to stay safe and trade happily. Auctions are NOT allowed. we don’t allow sales of toys higher than 125% their original cost on this subreddit. please read this for more detail: [Defining reasonable price for WTS posts and WTB comment offers](https://reddit.com/r/BadDragon/comments/rqamaq/defining_reasonable_price_for_wts_posts_and_wtb/)       

* We do not allow begging of any type. This includes but is not limited to toys, money, NSFW content. Begging for upvotes/comments both on and off Reddit is against sitewide TOS and you will be permanently banned. If anyone is found engaging in upvote manipulation they will receive a permanent ban and their posting history will be deleted for the safety of the subreddit as this breaches Reddit Terms of Service. This is non-negotiable and your ban cannot be appealed.

* No requests for nor advertising of links to Chat(room) Group/Servers. There have been issues with spam and other illegal activities connected to discord servers in the past therefore we don’t allow them, telegram, skype, kik, etc. Chat(room) Group/Server links at all on our subreddit. 

* Our subreddit’s core reason for existing is to be a place for those in the body safe sex toy hobby to come together and celebrate toys that are safe to use and unique in design. As such, we do not allow toys made of porous or toxic materials to be posted or talked about on this subreddit. Acceptable, Non Porous, Body Safe materials of toys that are allowed to be posted or talked about on this subreddit include and are limited to: 100% Platinum/Addition Cure Silicone, Acrylic, Annealed Glass, Anodized Aluminum, Stainless Steel, Titanium, Properly Enameled Ceramic, and Wood that has been Properly Treated and Sealed.

* Toys must be fantasy in nature, but this is up to moderator discretion. The shape, colour and/or manufacturer of a toy will be used on a case by case basis to discern what is and is not considered fantasy in accordance with the subreddit's standards. The only exception being realistic models from fantasy toy companies. If a company is blacklisted by the subreddit then none of their models may be displayed here. Realistic models from FANTASY toy companies (like Archer from Bad Dragon or Fighter from Pleasure Forge) are allowed on the subreddit.

* The original designs of the toys on display throughout our subreddit are incredibly unique and intricate. If we find a toy that has been made in the identical image or has been made directly copying certain features of another in an attempt to knock off/duplicate/mimic the original design we will act to protect the intellectual property of all the makers that pour their love into their craft. We take all types of copyright infringement very seriously. We do not allow reposting of stolen content, nor do we allow the sharing of companies known for stealing designs. Posts containing toys from companies known for design theft will be deleted, so if you're unsure of a company please feel free to message the Mod Team and we'd be happy to help.

**SUBREDDIT RULES**

If you're here to show off your big booty try Asstastic. If you're here to show off your slender, small, petite female self then you're in the right place.

#**Verification is required**. 

To get verified, post three different pictures (nudity required) holding a handwritten sign with your reddit username, the date and a shoutout to /r/gonewildcolor. Your body should be nude or partially nude from neck to knees in at least one pic.  See [additional verification instructions here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildcolor/wiki/verification).

We require verification in your posting history.  If you're verified on r/gonewildcurvy, just send the [moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgonewildcolor) a link to your verification post (the gonewild link, not the album link), and that *should* do. We reserve the right to require additional verification. We will not accept verification albums in Imgur from any sub. 

#**Tags**
*  If you are a verified couple, please use the [MF] or [FM] tag.

* We welcome female trans posters - use a [T] tag 

#**Rules**
*  Please see all subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildcolor/about/rules/).

*  r/gonewildcolor is now limited to **Female Self Posters and Verified Couples Only**.  

*  **Report** any comments or threads you find abusive. We check the reported queue often. If you come across a user being mean spirited or posting personal info, click the report link. Do not respond to trolls. Instead, report them!

*  **Be respectful**. Don't insult the ones brave enough to submit photos / videos. 

*  **Don't be a dick**. Don't make creepy, threatening, or malicious comments. Think you recognize someone? Keep it to yourself or you will be banned and reported to reddit admin.

* **No self-promotion or attempts to make a profit**. The nudity here is 100% free! No Snapchat, tumblr, kik, or social media links, and nothing to indicate making a profit or promoting oneself or one's personal sub.

* **Don't flood the feed**. Remember that GWColor is a shared community - please do not post more than twice a day. If you'd like to share lots of content, we recommend posting albums instead of single images. Users flooding the feed will receive a warning; multiple warnings will result in a ban.

* **No asking for upvotes (directly or indirectly)**. Vote manipulation violates Reddit site-wide rules as well as the rules of /r/GoneWildColor. Question captions / yes or no question are asked with the specific intent of generating upvotes / driving traffic to your OF make our sub look generic and spammy.

* **Verification**. Your verification album will need to remain in your posting history if you'd like to remain verified. Do not delete your verification post! If you do, your posts will be filtered until you submit updated verification.

* **Nudity** Every post doesn't have to contain nudity but most of them should.  Don't hold nudity hostage.  Posts with titles like ""Want to see the full video"" will be removed. 

* **Submission Quality** No low-res/poor quality images. No snapchat/instagram filters. No stickers. No ""body part"" posts. No censored ""bait"" posts (see my profile to find out how to get the uncensored pic/vid!). **Do not repost photos**

The Reddit spam filter sometimes mistakenly catches non-spam posts. If you think a submission of yours or someone else has been filtered, please contact the moderators.

#SUBREDDIT BI-LAWS

We are not a strictly moderated subreddit but we ask that you are accepting of all people (particularly in your language) and treat everybody with respect. In particular, please keep the following rules in mind:

1. **Bigotry** (biphobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, etc.) is not allowed. Acting in such a manner will result in a warning, temporary ban or permanent ban as the circumstances warrant. 
    * For more information on transphobia / fetishization in this subreddit see [this post] (https://old.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/bwje1b/transphobia_and_rbisexual/)
    * Posts showcasing biphobia should be spoilered.

2. **Erasing people's sexual orientations and/or gender identities** (e.g. denying the existence of bisexuality, asexuality, [pansexuality](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/k5z7dz/pansexuality_and_rbisexual/), or non-binary gender) is not allowed.

3. **No ""Low Effort posts""** This includes selfie posts, bi colors posts, stereotype posts, and other trends. **Selfie posts should be posted in /r/BisexualHumans.** As ""low-effort"" is a very relative term, the mods will use our discretion to determine what is and is not low effort. For a longer explanation, please see [the Post Types section in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/g8iodc/referendum_results/).

4. **Wednesdays and Thursdays are reserved for discussion.** ***This rule is not currently enforced but will be implemented in the future.*** On these days, no memes or jokes may be posted, only posts that foster meaningful discussion. This is to allow the post to remain an enjoyable place while also allowing for serious discussion to be heard. Discussion days follow UTC.

5. **All links to other subs must be in “no-participation” mode** (i.e. must begin with np.reddit.com). **All posts must be flaired** to assist in post filtering.

6. **Nude/pornographic and hook-up posts are not allowed** anywhere on the sub. Those should be posted in /r/BiSexy (NSFW) or other subreddits appropriate for that type of content.

7. **Memes reposted within 1 month of the last time they were posted are subject to being removed.**

8. **Research posts must meet certain criteria:**
    * Surveys must be related to bisexuality or the LGBT community, **and**
    * Surveys must be approved by an ethics board or similar body. Please 
post a link to the corresponding letter of approval.
    * All research not meeting this criteria must be submitted to the moderators for approval before being posted.

###Want more posts with just OC? Try using the [FILTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/search?q=OC&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all).

Please include text recipes in your comments, if possible. 

**Submission Rules**

**Rule 1 - Posts Must Be Foodporn Related**

* As r/FoodPorn is a food photography subreddit, all posts and comments must relate, in some way, to food photography. Any comments or posts that are hateful, rude, or antagonizing will be removed and the user may be banned at the mod’s discretion. Do not engage with trolls. Any gatekeeping of content that you deem unworthy can result in a removal of content and result in a ban, per the mod team's discretion. 

**notes**
*We also will remove content that is not up to our standards as a food photography forum. Stage the food, make sure lighting is on point, make sure plating is on point. Make an effort. This is not a dumping ground for /r/food photos.*

**Rule 2 - Only Submit Single Images and Gifs**

* Gif's are only allowed as long as they comply with the rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/4nc3m0/rfoodporn_now_allows_gifs/).

* Videos, collections, interactive images/websites, and articles are not allowed.

**Rule 3 - Include Context in the Title**

* Include some context in the title (including the name of the food, not just the type of meal e.g. lunch). All non-OC must credit the content creator in the title. 
* If it is your image, please place an [OC] tag in the title. We also offer [OC] flair for users to flair their content. 
* If it is non-OC, use the “credit: content creator“ tag and include the name of the content creator.  

* Low effort titles will be removed. Please try and describe what's in your photo the best you can (e.g. ""Dim Sum Lunch"" or ""Antipasto with parma ham, olives, gruyere cheese, and breadsticks"").

**Rule 4 - One Non-Original Post Per Day**

* You may only post one non-original content post per day. A ""non-OC post"" is a photograph (or gif) that you did not create yourself.

**Rule 5 - Recipes should be in plain text**

* We do not require posts to include a recipe, however we do strongly encourage it. If you decide to include a recipe it must be posted in plain text in the comments section. You are free to link to off-site recipes, but there must always be a plain text version in a comment, if there is to be any recipe at all.

**Rule 6 - Civil Comments only**

* Please remember the human and keep your comments civil.

(Hover to expand)




Rule| Details
---|---
1. Your post should be relevant, encourage discussion, and be inclusive. | We prefer that titles be in the form of a question, but if this is not possible, please make sure either the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion. -- Use inclusive language e.g. Not ""How did you ladies choose a female name?"" but instead ""How did you find your new name?""
2. Be respectful, especially about how people identify themselves. | No bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc); no hateful speech or disrespectful commentary; no personal attacks; no [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs); no [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation); no [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing); no shaming based on stealth, open or closeted status.
3. No personal agendas. | /r/asktransgender is a place for discussion and is not a soapbox. If a post or comment indicates a personal agenda, or if it's clear they have not come here with an open mind, their post(s) will be removed.
4. No stirring the pot. | Please do not post threads that intentionally create drama, target a different sub or link to threads in a different sub, or otherwise encourage brigading.
5. Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on reddit. We are required to report members identifying as such to the reddit admins.  | ""Although we welcome users from all walks of life, reddit is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us."" [reddit.com Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy#wiki_children_under_13)
6. [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasktransgender) for approval before posting a questionnaire, survey, promotion, or advertisement. | Please review [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/wiki/rule6) for these types of post. Additionally, note that we do not allow fundraising posts/requests under any circumstances.
7. Posts with NSFW content must be marked. | Posts that center around genitals, breasts, sex, or content you would not discuss with coworkers, your grandmother, or other delicate company should be marked as NSFW.
8. No fetishizing or chasers | We will remove any posts treating trans bodies as fetishes or objects, and any posts that indicate your attraction is more important than your partner's dysphoria.

Dreams of the future reveal more about the mind of the dreamer than the future itself. 

This subreddit focuses on the futurist visions of eras past.  However posts may also contain contemporary art with a retrofuturist theme. 

Futurism was born out of humanity's reaction to a sudden thrust into technological revolution. To the many that witnessed the rapid change, it seemed technological utopia was fast approaching.  This unbridled optimism caused the collective imagination to run wild.  

Although many of these visions seem almost comical now - the spirit in which they were created is part of the reason you are currently looking into a glowing rectangle with unlimited, instant access to the sum of all human knowledge.

**POSTING GUIDELINES:**

**Vintage =/= Retrofuturism**

**Vintage Sci-fi =/= Retrofuturism**

Please avoid posting vintage technology, unless it has a intentionally and obviously ""futuristic"" design.  

I will work to prevent default sub syndrome: clickbait titling, meme-ification, etc.  So please watch the titling and try to be as informative as possible!  Vast majority of submissions have been perfect for the sub and the community is great.  Just want to nip any trends in the bud.  I reserve the right prune low-quality and/or questionable content to keep the frontpage looking good!

**Post only:**

**1. Futurist visions from eras past.**
  
**2. Contemporary art with a retrofuturist theme.**

**3. Discussion threads related to retrofuturism.**

#No music in this subreddit!

This is the sub for vaporwave art — meaning pictures/animations/movies created by you (or at least someone else). It is one of the few places where visual artists can share their vaporwave artwork and get feedback.


**We created a [new community on Lemmy](https://normalcity.life/c/vaporwaveart) where you can also post your vaporware artwork.**


If you want to post your tracks, do so in /r/Vaporwave. Anything unrelated to art is better suited for /r/VaporwaveAesthetics. For vaporwave meme pictures, /r/VaporMeme is preferable.

**Rules**

1. Posts should be related to the aesthetics of Vaporwave.
2. No music. Post links to SoundCloud, YouTube, Bandcamp and so on in /r/Vaporwave instead.

A. What is the COSS token based Fee Split Allocation?

- 50% of all cryptocurrency transaction fees on the COSS.IO exchange will be re-distributed to holders of the COSS token through a specialized smart contract.
- Hold more COSS = earn a larger percentage of the fee-split.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoECPmMvy4w.
- Of note, any token with it's own blockchain MUST be converted to Ethereum (ETH) prior to fee-split distribution.

B. Where should I keep my COSS tokens to receive my share of the Token Fee Split Allocation?

- Securely store in your wallet on COSS.IO and receive your portion of the fee-split every week.
- You can also store your COSS tokens in your MEW or Hardware wallet using the following instructions:
https://cosssupport.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/35000101647-settings-up-your-external-identifier-to-receive-your-fee-split-allocation-fsa-

#Welcome to /r/army 

This subreddit is geared toward the United States Army, but all are welcome to join regardless of military service.

Weekly Question Thread (N00b thread) |
---|
[**For all of your joining and reclassing needs.**](https://redd.it/17efx7c)  |

**Ask A Recruiter**  | 
---------|
[**Go ahead; they may buy you lunch.**](https://redd.it/16wx2ob) |

[**Where it's always the WFFA.**](https://discord.gg/tmuQwZNx3C)|

**Twitter Feed**|
---------|
[**Tweets of /army Front Page Posts**](https://twitter.com/rArmyReddit)|

**This subreddit has a wiki page** containing information and links to answered questions. [Click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/army/wiki/index) or on ""wiki"" in the top tab menu.

**Subreddit Rules:**| 
---------|
**1.** No [bigoted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) language or witch-hunting.       | 
**2.** Keep discussions civil. We are all on the same side.       |
**3.** AMAs with mod approval only. Same  for fundraising requests and ads for your products, as well as survey/research requests or petitions.|
**4.** Asking for or providing the answers to online or in-class military courses or tests is not allowed. **This also applies to discussing exploits in course software.**|
**5.** Suggestions to do anything fraudulent, immoral or illegal are not tolerated.| 
**6.** Overtly political posts are not allowed. |
**7.** Moderators are the final word in whether a post will be removed or not. We welcome civil discussion in the [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/army) but will not engage with flamebait, spam or outright attacks without the end goal of courteous dialogue.|




**Posting Guidelines:**| 
---------|
• (1) If your post could be answered by your NCO, Google or a 5 minute call with an Army Recruiter, then please do so. | 
• (2) Ensure your posts actually encourage discussion. No memes, low effort posts, reposts or crossposts from /r/all. If it is appropriate for /r/AdviceAnimals or any other meme or image macro subreddit, it is not appropriate for /r/army. Consider /r/armycirclejerk or /r/justbootthings instead. | 
• (3) This is not a pro-military circlejerk, but please have some sources to base the more controversial topics on. | 
• (4) Use the search bar. It is very likely that whatever you are about to post has already been posted before. **This includes questions about duty stations, MOSs, boots, or what to take to the field.**  | 
• (5) We don't all know what a 12V or a  35Q or a 94L is. Post the description along with your obscure MOS code.     | 
• (6) Please keep your flair text rank or duty-related. The purpose of flair is so we know you have a background in a particular subject matter. Moderators reserve the right to change flair at will.       | 
• (7) Source your posts well. No rumors, PNN or unfounded speculation. Links from USAWTFM, ASMDSS and similar at moderator discretion. No Stolen Valor.|
• (8) N00b / Joining questions go in the Weekly Question Thread (or Recruiter Thread) stickied at the top, in the black-on-gold link at the top, and in the sidebar. Do not answer n00b questions on the main boards. Use the report button. |

Read the rules and play nice.  

1. Stocks must be under $5 per share. It's in the name.  

2. Stocks must be available on the Robinhood mobile app. Again, it's in the name. 
  
3. No Crypto. Dogecoin isn't a penny stock. 
 
4.  Gain/loss porn is only allowed in the stickied Gain/Loss porn megathread. 
 
5. Don't spam. Do not promote any newsletter, education service, referrals, personal websites, or affiliate links.

 * In an effort to keep r/Stellar high quality, we highly encourage you to engage with the community before announcing your project. Karma farming causes suspicion among users and users engaging in it will not have posts approved.
 * Threats of any kind will not be tolerated and will result in a ban.
 * Debate is encouraged, but hostile language is not tolerated. Please be civil!
 * Follow [Stellar Community Guidelines](https://www.stellar.org/community-guidelines/) and [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)/[Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).
 * *A note on ICO's and other projects: r/Stellar aims to be a different kind of community. If you're planning an ICO on Stellar's network, that's great! However, please note that this community thrives on engagement. The karma and 15 day post limit are in place to encourage new users to interact in the comments, share their thoughts and ideas, and learn about the Stellar ecosystem. By engaging the userbase, in this way, you do a service to your project AND the community. Please do not try to circumvent this practice as it will likely lead to a ban.*
2. No spamming
 * No altcoin (BTC, ETH, XRP, NEO, etc.) discussion and/or promotion. Altcoins are off-topic in the Stellar subreddit.
 * No double posts. Use the search function to see if your post has already been shared.
 * No referral linking, it's strictly prohibited and can lead to permanent ban.
 * No ad services, or ads for commercial offerings.
 * No faucet or faucet farming offerings.
 * No cryptojacking or services using visitor's CPU power to mine cryptocurrency.
 * Please make sure it's clear how your post applies to Stellar.
3. No manipulation
 * No double accounts. Users should only use one account in r/Stellar - multiple accounts can lead to permanent ban.
 * No brigading, shilling, pumping, or FUD posts.
 * No votes manipulation like asking, buying, or offering, upvotes and/or karma. Moderators adhere to Reddit's global rules on [Vote cheating or vote manipulation](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or).
4. No trading or begging
 * No buy, sell, beg, or trade offers.
 * No donation requests.
 * No bounty or airdrop announcements.
 * No trading or market feeling posts (can be shared in **The Daily Stellar Chat Posts**).
5. No ICO / Project spam
 * No announcements or links to token sales, instead talk about the project.
 * No double announcements, ICO projects can only have one announcement in the sub. However, if you make changes to your project you can announce those updates. The best way to announce a project is AFTER you've engaged with the community for a while.
 * No votes manipulation, please adhere to our policy of [Vote cheating or vote manipulation](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or). 
 * No altcoin (ETH, ETC, NEO, etc.) token announcements, if the service does not use Stellar network then it shouldn't be considered sustainable to be shared in the sub.
6. No illicit activities
 * No plagiarism.
 * No content stealing from other users. This includes posts with stolen articles.
 * No pump'n'dump announcements.
7. No low-quality content
 * No memes/image macro threads (can be shared in **The Daily Stellar Chat Posts**).
 * No UPPERCASE (capital letters or caps) titles or text unless for acronyms.
 * No hyperbolic post titles. Example: ""I COULDNT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING, DOING THIS COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE"".
 * No baseless speculation and repetitive posts or comments.
 * No off-topic discussion, at least avoid it and try to add to the posts' subject.
 * No misleading titles in posts or when sharing links to external sources (please use official articles' titles).
 * No empty content posts, posts with just a title and no content will be removed.
8. No delegate content or support
 * No delegate support in the name of Stellar offer to other users.
 * No delegate content in the name of Stellar, or any other organisation unless you have explicit and official authorization.
 * No unscheduled AMAs, if you want to do an AMA in r/Stellar please contact moderation first and they will get you connected to the right person.
9. Do not share personal information
 * No doxing, eg. search for and publish private or personally identifiable information (PII).
 * No disclosure of yours or someone else's holdings.
 * No Public/Secret Keys sharing.
 * No surveys collecting personally identifiable information (PII) mainly to build a relational database including variables such as Public Key with username/location/contact and more that can identify users.
10. Please respect and communicate with the moderators
 * Always respect moderators, they are held to the same rules as the users and dedicate their personal time to ensuring /r/Stellar stays safe.
 * Report abusive moderation to the [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FStellar) if needed, or if mods don't justify their actions to you.
 * If you're banned from the sub you can still use it and contact modmail to justify your actions but you can not register another account to post or comment new content. If you use another account to circumvent the ban, that will be considered a violation of [the Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior) and can result in your accounts being suspended from the Reddit.com site as a whole.
 * Mods are not 24h online, patiently wait for their communication.

Welcome!


Stellar is an open-source, distributed payments infrastructure. It is leapfrog technology that connects people, payment systems, financial institutions and banks with a focus on the developing world. It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for fractions of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.

**About Ripple Protocol:**
>""XRP exists natively within the Ripple protocol as a counterparty-free currency, as Bitcoin does on the Blockchain. Because XRP is an asset, as opposed to a redeemable balance, it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it. All other currencies on Ripple do require some amount of trust, as they each have an issuer, from whom that currency can be redeemed (this includes BTC on the Ripple network).""

##IOTA - Economy of the Future
> *IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol launched in 2015 that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless ‘Tangle’. The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-resistant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose digital currency '[iota](https://i.imgur.com/lsq4610.jpeg)' has a fixed money supply with zero inflationary cost.*

> *IOTA uniquely offers zero-fee transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second. Scaling limitations have been removed, since throughput grows in conjunction with activity; the more activity, the more transactions can be processed & the faster the network. Further, unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators (miners / stakers); rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.*

> *IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other applications where a scalable decentralized system is warranted.*

#####Posting Rules

>
1. Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.
2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.
3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.
4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.
5. Bots require moderator permission to operate
6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.
7. Account age: >1 day to comment, >5 days to submit content
8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed
9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.
10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines
11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission
12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content
13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

921,nem,NEM community subreddit,"NEM (New Economy Movement) is a dual-layer blockchain with 100% original source code. Launched on March 31, 2015, the NEM mainnet supports multiple ledgers on its cryptocurrency layer, and the NEM Smart Assets layer supports mosaics to represent any asset. NEM’s proprietary coin is XEM, which is harvested (mined) using a Proof-of-Importance (PoI) algorithm.



This community is for discussions regarding the blockchain platform.","* [Night Mode](https://nm.reddit.com/r/nem#icon-night) [Light Mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/nem#icon-day)

#### What is NEM?
* NEM is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency that gives control of their economy back to the people and establishes them as sovereigns over their own destiny. Focus on building exactly what you need, whether that’s a fintech system, tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, decentralized authentication, or much more - all without worrying about smart contracts. The NEM blockchain's range of features is made available to you through simple RESTful JSON calls to an API Gateway Server. This drastically simplifies creation of client apps, or interfacing servers to the blockchain. You can implement your usage of the blockchain using any language you prefer without being forced to reimplement existing business logic or develop in an unfamiliar environment.

> You can install the NEM wallet by following the instructions on the nem.io website. [Download NanoWallet](https://nem.io/downloads/)

A place to discuss dogecoin, come up with new ideas with the community.

Why Choose Dogecoin?
---
Superfast transactions, no network congestion & transaction fees of 1 dogecoin 

Designed to be actually used day to day. You could buy a cup of coffee without waiting till the shop closes for a confirmation, and also without paying anything close to the cost of the coffee in fees.  

Widely accepted on exchanges; a great tool to move between other crypto-currencies and fiat FAST while keeping fees low. (Try doing that with ANY other coin, they either don’t have the stability, reputation, volume or their fees are CONSIDERABLY higher)  

One of the oldest, well established, tried and true crypto-currencies, There have been considerable ups and downs in the value of the coin in comparison to fiat and other coins however it has stood the test of time and is still widely accepted and has remained a useful tool regardless of its exchange rate. (Which is why you will see 1 Doge = 1 Doge used frequently)
  
Strong positive community. Projects that show humanity, kindness, generosity. Among an ocean of get rich quick schemes, scams, pumps and dumps, this is the only coin which has a community centered on the positive things that crypto-currency can do

A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System1
, published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008,
has brought a whole new mode of thinking about decentralization. With the new mode
of thinking, Fortuna, the first blockchain platform for the global OTC derivatives
market, solves several core problems and introduces some new features as follows:

1. Build a trust network. Fortuna can solve the trust problem of the OTC
derivatives market with consensus algorithm DPOSA, structured smart contract,
decentralized quote scheme, digitalized supervision and other techniques of blockchain.

2. Improve the operational efficiency. As a specialized blockchain platform for
derivatives, Fortuna can improve the operational efficiency of each step of transactions,
including contract creation, price quoting, contract signature, trading and clearing.

3. Increase the liquidity. As the only medium of exchange accepted by Fortuna,
FOTA can enable the platform to embrace the global liquidity pool regardless of the
physical and multi-currency barriers.

4. Motivate users to trade. Fortuna supports two modes of trading: PrC and PuC.
Under PrC mode, users can launch a peer to peer transaction without any cost of agency.
Under PuC mode, users can create new types of derivatives and be the market makers
while benefiting from the trading volume of the new derivatives created.
5. Enrich the derivatives market. Users of Fortuna can create all kinds of
derivatives with different underlying assets, deal structures, durations, margin ratios
and other elements of transactions. To some extent, Fortuna can be a worldwide
incubator for innovative derivative tools.
6. Algorithmic regulation and self-discipline. With algorithmic regulation and
self-discipline, Fortuna supports transparent, real time, and full dose data supervision.
Smart contract, digitalized supervision, arbitration driven by consensus algorithm and
other new technical features can inspire a new mode of regulation and self-discipline.
As Herbert Marshall Mcluhan said, “we shape our tools and afterwards our tools
shape us.” Fortuna will inspire a new mode of thinking for the global OTC derivatives
market and make the tools of hedging more available and more popular.

Adoption is the goal|This is a channel for adoption information—not signals, speculation, or predictions. Please ask useful questions and provide insightful information about plans, strategies, achievements, and use cases.|
DYOR|It’s your responsibility to manage your ENJ appropriately. Do not ask for advice to whether you should buy or sell—instead, do your own research and ask questions to gain the information required to make your own informed decisions.|

No FUD|Misleading or irrelevant information that creates fear, uncertainty, or doubt will not be tolerated.|

####RULES

**#1 Be nice, welcoming, and friendly**

This should be self-explanatory. We don't need to hold hands and sing kumbaya, but if you're gonna be a jerk you're gonna get banned.

**#2 No Spam or Shilling**

There's lots of people posting links to Discord pump n dump channels and people trying to disguise shillposts as NANO discussions. Not cool.

**#3 No Begging**

Don't post asking for others to send you NANO. Just don't.

**#4 No Bragging**

On the flip side, don't post how much NANO you own. You wouldn't go around posting your bank balance on a random reddit forum would you?

**#5 No Illegal Activities**

Do we really need to explain this one?

**#6 Use Suitable Titles**

Be clear in your title post, and use proper grammar and capitalization. Posts with titles like ""M00n L4mb0s Bo1s!!11!"" will be removed.

**#7 No Empty Content Posts**

Posts with little or no content will be removed in order to cut down on spam, so put some effort in your post if you plan to contribute.

**#8 No Off-Topic Posts**

/r/NanoCurrency is for discussions about the Nano technology, protocol, wallets, etc. Discussions of moon lambos and funny memes are cool, but should go to /r/NanoTrade.
This includes picture and video submissions.

954,starterpacks,Starterpacks,Home of starterpacks!,"* [Full rules and policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/wiki/index)

# Rules

**1. Must be a Starter Pack**

 Your post must be a starter pack, not a list or any other meme.  Remember:  attributes, not examples.

**2. Be creative**

Jokes that are done to death, recent reposts, slight edits of existing posts, reposts of top submissions are highy frowned upon, and may result in a temporary ban. This rule doesn't explicitly apply to posts involving recent events, only if it's done to death.

Text-only posts, posts simply with examples of an item, and posts about you will most likely be removed.

**3. No blatant bigotry**

Slurs and racism that would get you fired are not allowed here.

**4. Be nice to each other**

You don't have to agree with each others opinions, just try to be civil in your discussions.

**5. No politics**

Incidental political items in a starter pack are okay, but this sub is not an arena for political agenda posts or political arguments.

**6. Starterpacks must contain 2 or more unique images**

The userbase has decided that single item starterpacks are lazy not starterpacks and must contain more than one item. Duplication of one item to make up the pack can be seen as a subversion of this rule and will be removed at moderator discretion.

Emoji and screenshots of text only do not count.

**7. Post title must include name of starterpack**

The title of your post must include the name of the specific starterpack you are posting. Low effort, single word, irrelevant post titles will be removed at moderator discretion.

**8. No reposts**

We want OC (Original Content).

**9. Imgur/Reddit image posts only**

In order to prevent spam, posts to /r/starterpacks must be submitted as images hosted on Imgur or Reddit only.

If you would like to arrange something, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEnoughTrumpSpam)!



###**Rules**



1.    **Trump trolls** will be banned. Trump supporters here *not to troll* are welcome, subject to the same rules as everyone else:

2.    **Civility**: maintain it & decorum. No calls for violence. No personal attacks. No whataboutism, gaslighting, sea-lioning, or other clear bad faith arguments.

3.    **No off-topic posts**. Repeat offenders will be banned. This subreddit is meant to be anti-Trump. Let's keep it that way.

4.    **No low-effort shitposts** except on Saturday. This includes posts begging for votes (""<---"" or ""Upvote to..."" posts), reposts, and karmawhoring. You can shitpost, but only if it is a good shitpost.

5.    **No bigotry**. This includes racism, sexism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc. Sic-quotes containing slurs are allowed.

6.    **No self-promotion**. Please do not post blog spam or try to sell anything for personal gain.

7.    **No linking to/mentioning antagonistic subreddits**. Screenshots allowed if usernames are blacked out.

8.    **Sources must be original & legitimate**. 
 - No fake news, sensationalist articles, or satire presented as real news.  
 - No articles that mainly quote other articles. Submissions must be primary sources unless they substantially add to the original source.

9.    **No conspiracy theories** without sufficient, legitimate evidence from reputable primary sources to back up your claims. Breitbart, InfoWars, and Hannity are bad sources.   
We landed on the moon. Vaccines do not cause autism. Hillary Clinton did not kill Seth Rich. Pizzagate is not a thing. NASA is not running a child sex ring on Mars.

962,CommunismWorldwide,Communism Worldwide,"A subreddit for all communists, and those interested in communism, to discuss issues surrounding the world today.","*Communism- an ideology and philosophy defined by a classless, stateless society.*

This subreddit is open to all communists, and anyone else interested in communism. It is to discuss news, events and issues relevant to all communists. We do not wish to be converted, nor to debate the merits of capitalism, there are plenty of other subs for that. It is not a place for bigots to use as a platform for their ideas either. Therefore, any racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, nationalist, classist, ableist, or any other hateful comments will be removed, and will result in a ban upon second transgression.

**Subreddit Guidelines**

1. **Absolutely no oppressive speech** or supporting/apologising for/advocating/minimising oppression of any kind. This includes but is not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, classist, ableist, islamophobic or any other form of systemic prejudice. The comment will be removed, and you will receive one warning. Continued behaviour will resort in a ban.

2. **No personal attacks against other subscribers**, this means no insulting them on the basis of their gender, ethnicity, nationality, age or other arbitrary characteristic that isn't relevant to the discussion at hand. Questioning their ideology, going through their post history and holding them accountable for things they've said in the past is not considered a personal attack.

3. **This is a subreddit for Communists of all kinds**, whether Marxist or Anarchist. If you're not a Communist you're still welcome to look around, post questions and participate—with the understanding that we don't want to be ""converted"" or debated on the basic principles of Marxist or Anarchist theory, ideology, analysis or critiques of Capitalism. Don't derail a discussion you disagree with if you have nothing constructive to add.

4. **All Communists are welcome to comment and post on this subreddit**. Therefore, refrain from engaging in sectarian behaviour such as insults (calling Trotskyists traitors, calling Anarcho-Communists lifestylists, or Ecosocialists tree-huggers), or claiming that people of a certain branch of Communism (such as Marxist-Leninist-Maoists, or Anarcho-Syndicalists) aren't actual Communists. We all seek Stateless, Classless, Moneyless Communism.

5. **Blatant attempts at trolling, flaming, or brigading will be removed and the user(s) responsible banned outright**.

5. **Do not complain about posts whose source you don't like**. If the article is questionable, talk about it in the thread. If you think the article is oppressive in any way shape or form, report it, down-vote and for even faster action message the moderators.

* No Swearing/cursing/cussing. Automod will remove your comment and no one will ever see it.
* We don't need to explain 'be civil' to you, but if you can't obey this simple rule then you're out.

 * **No personal information**
* Doxing, witch-hunting, etc. is a violation of Reddit wide rules and will result in a ban


* Use the ""[/new](r/hailcorporate/new)"" function to see if it's already come up before posting.


 * **Wash your hands regularly**

You may be banned for the first offence

######**TIPS** 

 * Replace any brand names (company, product, celebrity, etc.) with something less descriptive, like [COMPANY], [PRODUCT], [CELEBRITY], and so on.
 * Flair your post after making it or it may be removed

---

#####THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND

 * If you don't report a rule violation, we probably won't see it.
 * If you make a post or comment that violates the rules Automod will remove it and no one will ever see it
 * posts about r/gaming, r/movies, r/ama, etc links are not encouraged as we all know that it is filled with advert type posts in their own specific subject. However when a different topic comes up it may qualify. E.g. posts about a soda brand in a television subreddit

968,cardano,The home of Cardano,Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.,"**Welcome to Cardano!**

Cardano is a highly secure blockchain written in Haskell. It allows formal verification of code, and easy extensibility through a layered architecture. Cardano's technology is built from peer-reviewed research at some of the world's foremost universities.

After more than two years of planning and development, we're delighted to announce that the Cardano blockchain was publicly launched on the 29th September 2017. Cardano's Ada token was then made available for trading on the 1st October at Bittrex exchange.

On this subreddit you can learn more about the project, understand its great potential and engage in the worldwide Cardano community!

You are expected to treat everyone with dignity and respect. Personal attacks and insults will not be tolerated and users will be banned.

We follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) here, an informal expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves.

Downvotes are for bad information or rudeness, not casual disagreement.


*Rule 2: Keep the discussions Cardano related and always look to add value*

All posts must be related to Cardano, Ada, or any projects and businesses related to the project.

Links, posts and comments not related to Cardano will be removed and repeat offenders will be banned.

Always look to add value where you can, we want this to be a place where people can learn more about the project and easily stay up to date with the most relevant news & updates.


*Rule 3: Scare tactics, hype, FUD and fake news are prohibited*

You are not allowed to post fake news or spread misinformation.

Repeated attempts to pump, shill, or spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) will result in a ban.

If you don’t have facts to back up assumptions then please do not post.


*Rule 4: No spamming or low value content*

Low-value content includes but is not limited to; memes (try r/ada_meme), reaction gifs, speculation/hype, old links, duplicate links etc.

Stakepool advertisement and NFT advertisement is not allowed.

*Rule 5: Please search for answers prior to posting*

You can find the answers to many questions you may have by using the Reddit search bar.

You can also browse the official [Help Centre](https://help.cardano.org/) to find in depth support articles and request assistance.

*Rule 7: Introductions and expression posts must be made in the Daily Thread*

Some examples of expression posts could be: announcing you've just bought ADA, staked your ADA, received rewards, announcing your feelings etc.

# Rules
* **Be Respectful -** This shouldn't need to be a rule, but this is the internet.  People can unnecessarily be jerks sometimes.  We'd much appreciate it if this wasn't a place where that happens.  Please refrain from talking down to people, being overly patronizing, name-calling, personal insults, etc.

  **Hate speech of any kind will not** be tolerated.  For a refresher, please see Reddit's entry on [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) as a general guideline.

* **No Spam / Excessive self-promotion -** Reddit has clear rules about [self promotion](https://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).  We encourage you to be proud of/promote your work to a degree, but we also don't want users using this sub as a link farm to promote their project/website/YouTube channel.

  Reddit recommends that <10% of your posts promote your content.  We're a *little* more forgiving, but don't take advantage of it.

  *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account.""*

* **No Memes/Low-Effort posts -** This sub is a place for discussion and news regarding the world of open source projects.  There are literally hundreds of other subs dedicated to memes and shitposting.  Please keep those kinds of posts in those subs.

* **Be On-Topic -** Posts should be of direct relevance to the open source community.  Off-topic posts will be removed.

* **No Sensationalized Titles -** If your post is a link to an article, please keep your post title as close to, if not the same as, the linked article's title. You're more than welcome to post a comment in the thread that states your opinion of said article.

* **No Drive-By Posting / Karma Farming -** Karma farm accounts are not going to be welcome here, regardless of the validity of the posted content. Drive-by posts from accounts where there is obviously no intention of engaging in the following discussion may be removed.

* **No Link Aggregators -** If there's an article within an aggregation of links/stories or a newsletter, link to the actual story or article.

We are digital librarians. Among us are represented the various reasons to keep data -- legal requirements, competitive requirements, uncertainty of permanence of cloud services, distaste for transmitting your data externally (e.g. government or corporate espionage), cultural and familial archivists, internet collapse preppers, and people who do it themselves so they're sure it's done right. Everyone has their reasons for curating the data they have decided to keep (either forever or For A Damn Long Timetm). Along the way we have sought out like-minded individuals to exchange strategies, war stories, and cautionary tales of failures.

We are one. We are legion. And we're trying really hard not to forget.

[](https://discord.gg/wWYnXBu/)

[](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligionCSS/submit?selftext=true&title=%5BOn%2DTopic%5D)

#### DebateReligion

A place to discuss and debate religion

#### Rules

1. **No Hate Speech**  
Posts and comments must not denigrate, dehumanize, devalue, or incite harm against any person or group based on their race, religion, gender, disability, or other characteristics. This includes promotion of negative stereotypes (e.g. calling a demographic delusional or suggesting it's prone to criminality). Debates about LGBTQ+ topics are allowed due to their religious relevance (subject to mod discretion), so long as objections are framed within the context of religion.

2. **Be Civil**  
Don't be rude or hostile to other users. Criticize arguments, not people. Our standard for civil discourse is based on respect, tone, and [unparliamentary language](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/wiki/unparliamentary_language/). 'They started it' is not an excuse - report it, don't respond to it.

3. **Quality Posts and Comments**  
Posts and comments will be removed if they are disruptive to the purpose of the subreddit. This includes submissions that are: low effort, proselytizing, uninterested in participating in discussion, made in bad faith, off-topic, or unintelligible/illegible. Posts and comments must be written in your own words (and not be AI-generated); you may quote others, but only to support your own writing. Do not link to an external resource instead of making an argument yourself.

4. **Thesis Statement and Argument**  
Posts must have a thesis statement as their title or their first sentence. A thesis statement is a sentence which explains what your central claim is and briefly summarizes how you are arguing for it.
Posts must also contain an argument supporting their thesis. An argument is not just a claim. You should explain why you think your thesis is true and why others should agree with you.

5. **Opposed Top-Level Comments**  
All top-level comments must seek to refute the post through substantial engagement with its core argument. Comments that purely commentate on the post (e.g. “Nice post OP!”) must be made as replies to the Auto-Moderator “COMMENTARY HERE” comment. Exception: Clarifying questions are allowed as top-level comments.

6. **Pilate Program is Available**  
Posts with titles following the format “[<demographic>]...” require that all top-level comments must be from users with flairs corresponding to that demographic. We expect all users to assign their flairs honestly to avoid comment removal. We encourage posters to appropriately address their submissions, thus identifying their target audience. All users are free to respond to top-level comments.

7. **Meta Threads Once a Week**  
All meta discussion of the sub must be done on the weekly meta thread. This is to avoid cluttering the sub and to gather feedback in one place so it’s easier for the mods to act on.

8. **Fresh Topics on Friday**  
On Fridays, all posts must discuss fresh topics. You must flair your post with “Fresh Friday.” We encourage posts about religions other than Christianity/Islam/atheism. Banned topics include: problem of evil, Kalam, fine tuning, disciple martyrdom, Quranic miracles, classical theism.

9. **Mandatory Flairs**  
All original posts must have an accurate flair that outlines the topic of discussion.

An OP directed at Muslims for example must be flaired ""Islam.""

This only applies to original posts.

**Definitions**

The words we use in religious debate have multiple definitions. There is no 'right' definition for any of these words, but conversation can break down when people mean different things by the same word. Please define the terms you use. If you don't, you are presumed to be using these definitions:

- god: A being or object that is worshiped as having more than natural attributes and powers
- Atheist: holds a negative stance on “One or more gods exist”
- Agnostic: holds a neutral stance on “One or more gods exist”
- Theist: holds a positive stance on “One or more gods exist”
- Agnostic atheist: doesn't believe god(s) exist but doesn't claim to know
- Gnostic atheist: doesn't believe god(s) exist and claims to know
- Omnipotent: being able to take all logically possible actions
- Omniscient: knowing the truth value of everything it is logically possible to know

**Moderation Policies**

Moderators cannot moderate discussions they are involved in.

995,CrazyIdeas,Crazy Ideas,Is your idea too crazy to work? So crazy it might work? Perfect.,"#####r/CrazyIdeas

Create super hobos? Elaborate. Invisible spiders? Why not? There are ***no*** wrong ideas!


#####Rules

1. Don't be a dick

2. Submit original, interesting ideas. Sense, rationality, possibility and ethics are for sissies.

3. If the entire purpose of the idea is the setup for a pun, it doesn't belong here.

	3.1. As a rule of thumb, if your idea ends in ""call it ___"", it's probably a bad idea.

	3.2. If an idea stands on its own as an interesting, crazy idea without the pun, submit it. Add the pun in 
	the comments or maybe in the description if you really want to.

4. Posts shouldn't be for the sole purpose of complaining about a certain thing rather than add an alternative.

	4.1. Examples are ""vote for Donald Trump"" or ""shut down Fox News"". It's not a crazy idea, it's just being
	 annoying.

	4.2. This goes for everything of the sort. No political bias here (we hope).


5. Please keep the circle jerk politics post to a minimum.

6. Some ideas are definitely more common than others. Use the search bar to see if it's been done before.

	6.1. ""Hold a special Olympics where everyone takes drugs!""

	6.2. ""Put all prisoners/politicians in an arena and make them fight to the death!""

	6.3. Literally anything to do with April Fools Day. If it involves April 1st, chances are you can remove
	the April 1st bit and it'd be just as valid.

	6.4. ""For just one day, swap these two subreddits!""

7. Tag NSFW posts.


**NOTE:** 

Awesome ideas are just as welcome here as well. Anything is possible, anything you think about can work in
your imagination. So don't comment saying ""this belongs in /r/AwesomeIdeas!"", we love you and accept you."

######[](#space)

######[](#space)
> ### 7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this."" These examples are by no means comprehensive, just don't self promote.

1005,philosophy,philosophy,/r/philosophy: the portal for public philosophy,"###[/r/philosophy Rules and Guidelines](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14pn2k9/welcome_to_rphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/?)

####Hover or Tap Each Rule for Full Details

##Posting Rules
1. ###All posts must be about philosophy. 
>To learn more about what is and is not considered philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit, see our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq). Posts must be about philosophy proper, rather than only tangentially connected to philosophy. Exceptions are made only for posts about philosophers with substantive content, e.g. news about the profession or interviews with philosophers.

2. ###All posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis.
>Posts must not only have a philosophical subject matter, but must also present this subject matter in a developed manner. At a minimum, this includes: stating the problem being addressed; stating the thesis; stating how the thesis contributes to the problem; outlining some alternative answers to the same problem; saying something about why the stated thesis is preferable to the alternatives; anticipating some objections to the stated thesis and giving responses to them. These are just the minimum requirements. Posts about well-trod issues (e.g. free will) require more development.

3. ###Questions belong in /r/askphilosophy. 
> /r/philosophy is intended for philosophical material and discussion. Please direct all questions to /r/askphilosophy. 

4. ###Post titles cannot be questions and must describe the philosophical content of the posted material.
>Post titles cannot contain questions, even if the title of the linked material is a question. This helps keep discussion in the comments on topic and relevant to the linked material. Post titles must describe the philosophical content of the posted material, cannot be unduly provocative, click-baity, unnecessarily long or in all caps.


5. ###Audio/video links require abstracts.
>All links to either audio or video content require abstracts of the posted material, posted as a comment in the thread. Abstracts should make clear what the linked material is about and what its thesis is. Users are also strongly encouraged to post abstracts for other linked material. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/abstracts) for an example of a suitable abstract.

6. ###All posts must be in English. 
>All posts must be in English. Links to Google Translated versions of posts are not allowed. 

7. ###Links behind paywalls or registration walls are not allowed. 
>Posts must not be behind any sort of paywall or registration wall. If the linked material requires signing up to view, even if the account is free, it is not allowed. Google Drive links and link shorteners are not allowed.

8. ###Meta-posts, products, services, surveys, AMAs and links to other areas of reddit require moderator pre-approval. 
>The following (not exhaustive) list of items require moderator pre-approval: meta-posts, posts to products, services or surveys, links to other areas of reddit, AMAs. Please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) for pre-approval.

9. ###Users may submit only one post per day. 
>Users must follow all reddit-wide spam guidelines, and in addition must not submit more than one post per day on /r/philosophy.

10. ###Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch.
>If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting /r/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth).  Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden. 

##Commenting Rules
1. ###Read/Listen/Watch the Posted Content Before You Reply
>Read the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively. If you have unrelated thoughts or don't wish to read the content, please post your own thread or simply refrain from commenting. Comments which are clearly not in direct response to the posted content may be removed.

2. ###Argue your Position
>Opinions are not valuable here, arguments are! Comments that solely express musings, opinions, beliefs, or assertions without argument may be removed.

3. ###Be Respectful
>Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Slurs, racism, and bigotry are absolutely not permitted.

***Rules****
____________________________________________________

____________________________________________________

1.) Don't be a dick.

2.) Low-effort question posts such as ""What's it like to drive for X company?"" or ""How much money do you make?"" will be removed. These questions get asked quite a bit, so please use the search bar before submitting a question. Validity of a question-based post will be left up to the mods' discretion.

3.) Please refer to stickied discussion posts if you have general questions about food delivery or other food industry related questions. If you have a different question that you want to post, please make sure that it is a story-leading question. 

4.) Absolutely no posting of personal information of co-workers, or customers. Not only is this against reddit's site-wide rules, it is incredibly unprofessional and handing out customer info will usually result in immediate job termination. Feel free to talk about yourself, your store, and general location, but leave specifics out. If a redditor can find out who you are by looking through your post history, then so can your employer.

5.) Don't start arguments about tipping, tipping culture, labor, or wages. If you want to have a civil discussion about it, that is fine, but if the discussion breaks Rule 1, we will remove it. This is not the sub for arguments.

6.) Obvious trolling will result in an instant, permanent ban.

7.) Any variation of “kill yourself” or other similar insults will result in an instant ban as well.

8.) No copypasta, obviously fake stories, or pun posts. Refer to Rule 2.

9.) If you don't believe a story, keep it to yourself. This isn't /r/thathappened and ""Reddit Truth Police"" will be banned immediately. We don't care about your opinions on validity.

10.) No linking to non-reddit forums and no advertising.

11.) No raiding of other forums or subs or ganging up on certain members. Also, try to keep the circle-jerking to a minimum. The downvote button isn't a 'disagree' button. If someone has an unpopular opinion, try to hear them out.

___________________________________________________________________

*^Rules ^can ^change ^at ^any ^time ^as ^the ^moderators ^deem ^necessary.  ^Definitions ^of ^'being ^a ^dick' ^are ^up ^to ^the ^mods' ^discretion. ^Racism, ^general ^trolling, ^and ^verbal ^abuse ^are ^included ^in ^that ^definition.
_________________________________________
Breaking of the rules can can have consequences up to and including:

* A stinky face flair next to your name
* Removal of your comment (free speech is for chumps)
* Banning from posting in this subreddit

1009,Marriage,Marriage,A place for sharing the for-better and for-worse of marriage.,"Welcome to /r/Marriage, Reddit's home for civil discussions about married life in a positive and helpful environment. Do you need help in your marriage? Are you having problems with your relationship? Are you thinking about marrying? Do you need advice? Conversely, do you want to celebrate something wonderful in your marriage? Or can you give aid to someone who needs help? These are the reasons why we are here.

How long have you been married?  Tell us with your flair!

Note: *Do NOT private message or use reddit chat to contact moderators about moderator actions. Only message the team via the [Message the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Marriage) link below. Directly messaging individual moderators may result in a temporary ban.*

##**Submission Rules**

* Most submissions should be self-posts. Link submissions that foster discussion are allowed from active members.

* No submissions or comments from media marketers, personal blogs, podcasts or videos, donation requests, affiliate links, or any other attempts to use our community for profit, marketing etc. or any other commercial promotion. Such messages or posts will be removed.

* Surveys and research may be posted within a single monthly thread created by the mods and pinned to the top of this subreddit. These survey posts are allowed if and only if such research is scientific or academic and if the results will be published publicly without a paywall. No market or commercial research will be allowed. If you have questions, send a note to the Mods.

* Posts must contain marriage-related content in the link/post body, not just a ""forced"" connection via the title or a caption added to the content.Posts also must have text explaining the topic.  No ""AITA"" posts. There are better ways to raise these issues. Title-only and 'AITA' posts are automatically removed.

* This is a pro-marriage equality subreddit. Discrimination based on legally protected classes (based in the US) such as race, gender, sexuality, gender identity, religion, age, ability, nationality, color, or creed will not be tolerated.

* This is a no-troll zone. Behavior whose sole purpose is meant to frighten, harass, attack, diminish, infuriate, insult, or manipulate another will, similarly, not be tolerated. This includes ""YTA"" comments. Reality is based on perception, if you test the limits, we'll likely err on the side of you or your comments getting blocked.

* No brigading or cross-posting from any subreddit or forum that regularly breaks these rules is allowed

* Respect others and their points of view while participating in the sub by maintaining civil discourse.

* Please assist the mods and report inappropriate posts, users, and comments.

##**Helpful Resources**

Much more information can be found in [this sub's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/wiki/index). 

You will find books, articles, videos and many other resources to help in your marriage. There is also information on many common issues and popular topics in marriage, along with links to find professional help and to many other useful subreddits."
1010,dykesgonemild,We like our girls mild,A place to post SFW pictures of ourselves.,"1. This is a subreddit for SFW pictures only. NSFW (Nudity, lingerie, your butt, your underboob, etc) pictures WILL be removed. If you wouldn't want it to pop up when your boss was walking by, it probably doesn't belong here. Post in /r/dykesgonewild instead!

2. Submissions MUST contain your face (Your foot, your tattoo, your phone covering your face, etc) do not fit here, even if said foot or tattoo is attached to a dyke.

3. Submissions must be of just you, not you and your girlfriend, not you and a famous person, etc. Public spaces with others in frame and pictures of you with your pets are of course allowed.

No proselytizing.

Promoting, supporting, and recruiting for groups that oppose our goals will also result in a ban.

###Rule 3: We stay on-topic.

* Do not harass or make false claims.

**#2 No Spamming or Shilling**

* If it's not related to Nano, it has absolutely no place in here
* Self promotion / shilling / advertising your websites or others is not allowed unless it relates to Nano in a specific way.

* No referral links

**#3 No Begging**

* Asking for free Nano is not ok.
* Donation-seeking projects should have prior approval from moderators.
* Asking for or manipulate votes in any way is not allowed (site-wide policy). That also includes posts in other subs, as in brigading. Use np.reddit.com if linking to other nano discussions.

**#4 No Bragging**

* Do not mention how much you own for bragging rights
* Don't laugh at others' expense

**#5 No Illegal Activities**

**#6 Inadequate Title**

* Be clear in your title post, and use proper grammar and capitalization.

**#7 No Low Effort Posts**

* A typical post is required to have at least a few sentences that aim to initialize a discussion. Title only posts are not allowed.
* Direct links to news, tweets, images or videos is discouraged if not accompanied by a discussion comment. Especially if not concerning Nano.
* Please refer to our discord ""Off-topic"" channel or this sub's Daily General Discussion for light content.

**#8 No Redundant Posts**

**#9 No Off Topic Posts and Comments**

* /r/NanoCurrency is for discussions about the Nano technology, protocol, wallets, adoption, projects, etc.
* Price and trading discussions are welcome in the TNC trade channel: https://discord.gg/HVmm4TJ
* No Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading is allowed
* For funny memes and other off-topic content, please refer to our discord ""Off-topic"" channel.

**#10 No Brigading**

* Encouraging others to brigade other subreddits, either directly or indirectly, or to link to services or tools that can be used to manipulate Reddit or other social media platforms, is not allowed. This may result in an immediate ban.

**#11 Representing Nano in Other Communities**

* Please represent the Nano community positively and follow the rules of other communities.

**#12 No Trading/Price Related Posts and Links**

* Discussions of price, trading and speculative investment are not allowed
* Other communities exist where you can have these discussions, even those focused on Nano

**#13 No Inappropriate User Flairs**

* Users may set their own flags. Flairs that are inappropriate or break any other rule will be removed.
Repeatedly breaking this rule will result in a warning, ultimately followed with a ban.

**#14 Take Responsibility**

* Nano often involves owning the asset in a digital wallet. It's YOUR money and YOUR responsibility. Always save the Seed, it is essential to the security of your funds. If you have not done so, then we recommend you do that immediately and keep it safe.

* Our community won't be able to help you if you lose it!

**Flair Rules:**

* Only nano addresses/URLs in the Nano Rep/I Run a Node flairs. Others will be removed/changed. 
* There is also a plain text (only) custom flair option, all subreddit rules apply.

   If you have a question about admissions, either to the university or to an individual college such as Terry, go to the [admissions megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/sspp8k/admissions_questions_megathread/).

   Your post will be removed if it belongs in either of those two threads.

* **No advertising**

   Depending on the nature of the post, this rule may be relaxed for businesses local to UGA and Athens. Referral codes and affiliate links also fall under this rule and are never allowed.

##General Information

Welcome to /r/AMD — the subreddit for all things AMD; come talk about Ryzen, Radeon, Threadripper, EPYC, rumors, reviews, news and more.

/r/AMD is community run and does not represent AMD in any capacity unless specified.

##Rules

**Rule 1:** PC build questions and Tech Support posts are only allowed in the Questions and Tech Support Megathread - you can find the latest linked in the sidebar or pinned on the front page.

You may also want to use /r/AMDHelp, /r/TechSupport, /r/buildapc and [AMD's official community support forums](https://community.amd.com/t5/support-forums/ct-p/supprtforums)

**Rule 2:** e-Begging, asking for free PCs, sponsorships, components, posting referral or affiliate links, as well as asking for buying or selling advice is not allowed on /r/AMD

**Rule 3:** Be civil and follow side-wide rules, this means no insults, personal attacks, slurs, brigading, mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour

Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on /r/AMD

**Rule 4:** All posts must be related to AMD, their technologies or products

If a post is made and it is not clear how it relates to AMD, an explanation in the thread will be required that details why it is relevant, if the post lacks said comment, it will be removed

Content that is primarily about a competitor, their technologies, products or other industry that merely references AMD, their products or technologies would not meet this criteria

**Rule 5:** Battlestation posts, PC builds and pictures of PC components are **only allowed** between 0:00 UTC Saturday and 0:00 UTC Monday

**Pictures of boxes are not allowed under any circumstances**; this includes packaging and damaged packaging

**Rule 6:** Posts containing leaks, rumors, speculation or with other information not confirmed by AMD or one of AMD's partners (e.g. Sapphire, XFX, HP, Dell) must be flaired appropriately as rumor

**Rule 7:** Shitposts, memes and other low-effort posts are not allowed on /r/AMD

**Rule 8**: Straw polls and Reddit polls are not allowed — we encourage discussion and debate. Straw and Reddit polls are simple questions resulting in a yes/no answer or soliciting another ballot-type response

**Rule 9**: Changing the title of posts is not allowed, you must use the suggested Reddit title or copy/paste the title of the original link/video/article

Posts with altered titles will be removed and repeat offenders may be banned

**Rule 10**: Do not use Google AMP links, URL shorteners or post screenshots of Tweets, articles, videos or other content. You must submit the Tweet, article, video or other content as a link post

**Rule 11**: Posts with the benchmark flair must contain multiple games or configurations of hardware. Exceptions will be made for posts containing singular applications or hardware configurations if the post is a benchmark for unreleased AMD hardware or a world record

**Rule 12**: The mods of /r/AMD reserve the right to allow posts/comments that could break any of the rules, when a situation has arisen where the post is funny, educational or useful to the users of /r/AMD. We also reserve the right to remove posts or comments that may not technically break the rules in situations where moderators feel the post is not appropriate

If you have a post you believe warrants an exception, please [message us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmd)

#Verification


* Individuals posting are required to submit verification and prove you're the one in the photos. Consent is a critical part of the overall health of this community.

* Brand new and/or low karma accounts cannot be verified. Build up some posting history, gain some karma (post & comment) and try back in a few weeks.

* Submit Verification by clicking the **VERIFY HERE TAB** above and get flair! **[Read all about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealGirls/wiki/verification)**


###[Guidelines for verified posters](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealGirls/wiki/verified_user_guidelines)
 
#NOTE

 * If your account is brand new or has very little/no karma, you may be asked to build up some posting history before being verified.

 * If you've been banned in any of our other subreddits we reserve the right to ban you from here as well.

 * No couple's accounts


#How to verify

* Include your username, the date, and a mention of /r/realgirls. **Crumple the paper into a ball, and straighten it back out**. Take at least 3 color pictures of yourself nude or semi-nude holding the sign, from 3 different angles. Upload them to RedGIFS, then send us the link. **DO NOT** use Photoshop or any filters.

* Private messages from users asking for verification pictures? Gross, spammy or harassing PM's? Clicking the 'block' link helps bring it to the Reddit admin's attention. Then message the mods and let us know.

What we are about: quality and constructive discussion about the culture, profession and love of hacking.


This sub is aimed at those with an understanding of hacking - please visit /r/HowToHack for posting beginner links and tutorials; any beginner questions should be directed there as they will result in a ban here.

Guides and tutorials are welcome here as long as they are suitably complex and most importantly **legal**!
   
Bans are handed out at moderator discretion.

-----

###Rules:
1. **Keep it legal**
Hacking can be a grey area but keep it above board. Discussion around the legality of issues is ok, encouraging or aiding illegal activities is not

1. We are not your personal army. This is not the place to try to find hackers to do your dirty work and you will be banned for trying. This includes: 
    * Asking someone to hack for you
    * Trying to hire hackers
    * Asking for help with your DoS
    * Asking how to get into your ""girlfriend's"" instagram
    * Offering to do these things will also result in a ban

1. No ""how do i start hacking?"" posts. See /r/howtohack or the stickied post.
Intermediate questions are welcomed - e.g. ""How does HSTS prevent SSL stripping?"" is a good question. ""How do I hack wifi with Kali?"" is bad.
  
1. No ""I got hacked"" posts unless it's an interesting post-mortem of a unique attack. Your nan being phished doesn't count.
 
1. Sharing of personal data is forbidden - no doxxing or IP dumping    
 
1. Spam is strictly forbidden and will result in a ban. Professional promotion e.g. from security firms/pen testing companies is allowed within the confines of site-wide rules on self promotion [found here]  
(https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion), but will otherwise be considered spam.
 
1. Off-topic posts will be treated as spam.     

1. Low-effort content will be removed at moderator discretion

1. We are not tech support, these posts should be kept on /r/techsupport
 
1. Don't be a dick. Play nice, support each other and encourage learning.

* /r/Linux_Gaming is for informative and interesting gaming content, news and discussions. **It is not (primarily) a tech-support forum**. 
* **Tech-support requests should be readable by and useful to others.** Include relevant details like logs, terminal output, system information. What exactly did you do, and how, and with what version of what? How have you tried to troubleshoot the problem? **Vague, low-effort tech-support requests may get removed.** See this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/16d7gj7/need_help_heres_how_to_get_it/) for help. 

* Check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/16xx5yv/faqs/) **before asking a question**.

* **Respect other users.** Heated discussions are fine, unwarranted insults are not. Remember you are talking to another human being.

* **Devs and content producers:** If you've ported your game to Linux or created some GNU/Linux-gaming-related content (reviews, videos, articles) then, so long as you're willing to engage with the community, please post it here. If it's a link post, think about writing a comment to tell us more — the more you engage with us, the more we like it. We all need to support each other to help GNU/Linux gaming grow.

* **Spam will be deleted**. This means things like repetitious posting of similar content, low-effort posts/memes and misleading/exaggerated titles on link posts. We know spam when we see it and will delete it.

#Subreddit Rules


1. **Keep it civil and on topic** - Posts must be directly related to Battlefield 4. No witch hunting or calling out other users. Do not personally attack other users, and do not ""name and shame"" specific users or servers with OR without evidence. This includes refraining from posting personal information of others. Do not post inappropriate language, including but not limited to sex, race, and religion. 
* Spoilers and NSFW posts must be properly marked. 
* Memes, image macros, reaction gifs and low quality posts are usually not allowed (put some effort into it at least). 
* Discussion or links to jailbreaking / hacking / cheating / fraud / piracy / account trading and sharing / e.t.c. is not allowed. 
* ""Can my PC run it?"" posts are not allowed. There are other subreddits/websites for this.
* No advertising, selling, buying, trading, or begging for anything.
* Original user made content is allowed. Excessive self promotion or promotion for financial gain is not allowed. You know the difference. Stop looking for subs here.
* Do not submit baiting or ""circlejerking"" posts, or posts with the intent of belittling a certain player or playstyle.

This is not a satirical or circlejerk subreddit. This is a normal casual Linux subreddit with some satirical & humor elements.

Looking for help? Check /r/linux4noobs and /r/linuxquestions, they have more subscribers you'll find help there easier.

Want to learn about linux? https://linuxjourney.com/

**About**

A subset of the Glorious PC Master Race, the Linux Master Race promotes the glorious operating systems that run using the free and open source Linux kernel. Linux differs from the disgustingly proprietary operating systems like Windows and Mac OS by being open and freely influenced by anyone with the necessary desire and abilities.

**Why use Linux?**

* Less malware than OSX and Windows.
* It's faster and more efficient than OSX and Windows.
* No bloatware included.
* You can make your desktop look however you want. [Literally](/r/unixporn).
* You can update all your computer's software with a single click.
* Runs on pretty much anything, no matter how old it is.
* You can see every line of code it uses, so you know there's no NSA backdoor.  [They tried (and failed) to get a backdoor inserted into Linux](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/19/linux_backdoor_intrigue/). There are also no keyloggers built-in, [unlike in Windows](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-windows-technical-preview-data,27816.html)
* It costs exactly $0.
* According to Gabe Newell, it's the future of PC gaming (as is [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown)).
* By using it, you ascend even higher into the /r/PCMasterRace
* [Also check our wiki (WIP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/wiki/index)



**Rules**


We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

\#1) Respect the privacy of others.  
\#2) Think before you type.  
\#3) With great power comes great responsibility.   

For expansions on the three basic rules, view [the full rules page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/about/rules/).

Additionally, posts that are Microsoft/Windows related may only be posted on Mondays.  Posts including Microsoft/Windows that also relate to Linux might be allowed according to moderator discretion.

# Please check that it is Monday on UTC before posting something MS or Windows related!

**I use Windows or Mac alongside Linux.  Can I join the Linux Master Race?**

* Alas, currently the Mac squids, and even more so the Windows krill, do not realize the inevitable triumph of the Linux OS.  This is an unfortunate fact, and it may force many penguins to use the crude systems of the seafood.  Even if persecuted in this way, as long as one believes in the supremacy of Linux, one may become a member of the Linux Master Race. One day the trials will end and we shall rise above all, but use the systems of the squids and krill for what you need and only for what you need, and persevere in the hope of the future.

**Please Note:**

Before posting a question, please take a time to read our [Wiki](/r/oblivion/wiki), it includes our FAQ, our modding tutorial, the subreddit rules, and some common recommended mods.

###.

**Regarding The Wiki:**

/r/oblivion strives, in part, to be a community where users can learn how to best enjoy their game. Our wiki should be a resource that every one of our users can go to when they need help, for bugs, or mods, or anything about Oblivion. At the moment it is sorely lacking, and we'd like to remedy that. 

If you want to help us out, please send us a message so we can add you as a contributor! If we see you commenting thoughtfully, we'll probably send you a message first, but unfortunately we don't see everyone. Being a contributor even has a few special perks, but they're a secret for the moment. Again, this is a resource the entire community should be able to learn from, and we really need your help.

Thanks.

**Regarding Bugs:**

Quite often on this sub we get users who ask for help for bugs, or with mods, that have been solved before. To reduce this clutter, we have a link search filter. To save everyone some time, try searching for bugs that might be similar to any you are having. Remember to add keywords if your problem is a specific one.

[](#bigspecialbutton) [Native 60 fps Content](https://na.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/#na)

---
#Welcome

60 frames per second (fps) is smoother and more life-like than the standard 24 or 30 fps.

---

##Native vs. Interpolated

**Native**: Video shot (natively) at 60 fps.

**Interpolated**: Software estimates what happens between existing frames (interpolation) in video shot at less than 60 fps.

[](#bigbutton) [Interpolation Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/wiki/Interpolation)

---

#Rules

##1. Framerate

Content must be **60 fps** - both native and interpolated video is allowed.

[](#bigbutton) [Determining Framerate](https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/wiki/FPS)

---

##2. Quality

**Resolution != quality**.

For Gfycat submissions, clips must be converted to the **WebM** format before uploading, otherwise there is significant compression and quality loss.

Examples of programs to convert to WebM are:

[](#button) [XMedia Recode](http://www.xmedia-recode.de/en/download.html)[](#button) [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

[](#specialbutton) [Gfycat Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/wiki/Gfycat) [](#specialbutton) [More In-Depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/wiki/GfycatQuirks)

## 3. Flair

All posts must be **flaired** with either ""Native"", ""Interpolated"", or ""Unknown"" when submitting.

1079,cumsluts,The stickiest place on Reddit!,Lovely ladies loving cum.,"---

*Welcome to the high-protein diet subreddit.*

---

**Subreddit rules ಠ\_ಠ**

1. **Cum required!!**

    All posts **MUST** have actual semen in them.

    **Fakes are not allowed.** That includes both manipulated images and [fake gel cum](https://gfycat.com/wickedlivelychicken). Users who [repeatedly post fakes](/2j78ks) will be banned.

2. **Girl-guy content only!**

    Gay content belongs in /r/gaycumsluts.

    **Solo male** content, including cum tributes of pictures, is off-topic here.

3. **Legal pictures and videos.**

    Obviously.

4. **No spam.**

    Easy way to get banned.

    Unsure if what you're doing is spam? **Then yes, it is.**

---

* **Post approval:** Reddit's ""spam filter"" was worse than useless and was [crippled on 2021-June-23](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/o6l2z5/f_spammers/h2t37yb/).

    So, currently, almost all posts in r/cumsluts are only visible once *manually approved*.

    If your post here is not yet visible, please do not delete it! Wait for it to be approved (or rejected).

* **See spam?** Use the 'report' button. **Don't assume someone else did!** Or [message a moderator](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcumsluts).

* **Domain whitelist:** i.redd.it, v.redd.it, Imgur, RedGIFs, EroMe, Vidble.

    Submissions (not comments) that link to sites not on the whitelist are removed automatically.

* For still photos, [direct links](https://i.imgur.com/qQokVV5.jpg) to files are preferred.

* Sources in the comments are much appreciated.

* Watch out for impersonators/catfish. They run rampant on Reddit.

The Witcher is a critically acclaimed fantasy book series created by Andrzej Sapkowski. The series follows Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter in a universe where people often prove more wicked than beasts. Though originally written in Polish, the franchise gathered a large international following from likewise acclaimed game adaptions by CD Projekt. The books now translated into a dozen languages have also been adapted for TV.

#Content Philosophy:
Content which benefits the community (news, rumours, and discussions) is generally allowed and is valued
over content which benefits only the individual (technical questions, help
buying/selling, rants, self-promotion, etc.) which will be removed if it's in violation of the rules.

---
#Rules:
####Hover for more info
###1. Only submissions that are directly related to Android are allowed.
- All posts to r/Android must be related to the Android OS or ecosystem in some way. If not obvious, you should submit the link as a self-post and include an explanation. Comments that devolve into purely political discussions may be locked and people in violation may get banned if they are also violating Rule 9.

###2. We welcome **discussion-promoting** posts that benefit the community, and not the individual.
- We welcome posts that benefit the community (device reviews, guides, discussions and rumors) and not the individual (seeking help, e.g. tech support, purchase advice, app recommendations). You might be interested in r/AndroidQuestions, r/PickAnAndroidForMe or r/AndroidApps instead.
- If you're asking a question, include your own analysis first in a few sentences. Discussion-promoting rants are okay at mods' discretion.

###3. Images/videos must be in **self posts**.
- Please provide an explanation in the self-post body. No memes.
- YouTube videos are fine as links, provided they don't break other rules.

###4. No self-promotional spamming
- Developers may post their own apps if they follow these conditions:
- 1- Their post must be a self post with a detailed description of their app.
- 2- The developer's account must be at least three months old AND have a reasonable posting history on r/Android.
- 3- The developer must interact with users in the thread. We do not allow developers to simply dump a link to their app and leave.
- Website/blog/YouTube channel owners are generally not allowed to post their own content; please see [this page](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

###5. No reposts or blog-spam/rehosted content
- Submit the original source whenever possible, unless it's not in English or the article adds substantial information.
- Reposts are not allowed. This includes an article whose information has already been covered by another article posted on r/Android.

###6. No editorializing titles.
- Please do not change the link's title when submitting it, unless necessary to accurately sum up the article. You may freely add ""[Author]"" or ""by Author"" if it clarifies the article's source (e.g. YouTube video).
- If you want to discuss something specific, use the comments or submit it as a self-post (see rule 2).

###7. No piracy.
- Do not link or discuss pirated apps/piracy websites.

###8. No **unauthorized** polls, surveys, bots, or giveaways.
- To prevent scams, we require that all polls or giveaways be approved by the moderators. [Modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid) with your request before you post any poll or do any giveaway. 
- Only pre-approved bots are allowed on /r/Android. Currently, the only bot we allow to be invoked is the LinkMe_Bot. This bot can be summoned by commenting ""Linkme: APPNAMEHERE."" without quotes. If you wish to use your bot on this sub, then [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid) and show us that it can serve a useful purpose here.

###9. No offensive, hateful, or low-effort comments.  
- Do not be rude to any other user. Be respectful, adhere to [redditquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), or you may be banned.
- Do not use hate speech of any kind.
- Do not be disrespectful towards another for their personal choices (excessive fanboyism).
- Do not accuse others of being ""paid shills.""
- Do not post low-effort/circlejerky comments.

###10. No affiliate links.
- If you are a Redditor, affiliate links are absolutely NOT allowed in either the comments section, within the self-text of your post, or as part of your link.
- If you post an article, affiliate links will NOT be allowed if the article being linked is a simple ""deal alert"" type post. Instead, simply link directly to the deal (without the affiliate link included).

1099,redditrequest,RedditRequest - Adopt an unmoderated community!,This subreddit is for requesting moderation privileges for an abandoned subreddit or to remove an inactive top mod from a subreddit you currently moderate.,"**The current review time for requests is 5 days. (Updated 25 October)**

To request a subreddit, submit a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/submit) by linking to the subreddit in question. If the top mod of a subreddit you moderate is still active on the site, please use [this process instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal).

If you're looking for some inspiration or are new to moderating and would like some experience, check out our [new wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/index) which lists a huge amount of subreddits that are currently unmoderated and available for request. 

**Please read before posting**

**Requesters:**

+ Your account must be at least 28 days old and have at least 100 comment karma to request a subreddit. Awarder and awardee karma **do not** count towards this total. Your account must also have a verified email address to request a subreddit. 

+ Automod will respond to every request, but sometimes a request will be missed by the bot. If there is no message after a couple of days, it has automatically been moved to manual review. **Please do not delete your request if there is no comment.**

+ When a request is made, an automatic message will be sent to the mods of that sub asking them to respond to the request. We allow a 5 day grace period for moderators of requested subreddits to receive and respond to this message. This timeframe should not be taken as an indication of when you can expect a response to your request.

**Moderators:**

+ If you already mod a subreddit whose top moderator is inactive across Reddit and wish to remove your top mod, post a link to your subreddit and put the name of the mod you’re wanting to remove in the subject line.

+ If you already moderate a subreddit that has a top moderator who is inactive in your subreddit but active elsewhere on Reddit, you will need to use the [top mod removal process here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal).

+ If you are already the moderator of a **subreddit that was banned due to lack of moderation** and would like to appeal that ban, please contact r/modsupport via modmail instead of r/redditrequest. 

+ To be considered an active mod, you **must** be actively moderating your subreddit. 

+ If there has been no activity on your account in the last **30 days**, you will be considered **inactive**. Solely logging in does not count as activity. 

+ When a request has been made, you will receive a message from request_bot linking you to the modmail message from the user who is requesting the subreddit. 

+ If you would like to continue moderating this subreddit **you must reply in the comments of the request within 5 days**. Failure to do so will result in the subreddit being eligible for reddit request. 

+ You must have **valid reasons** when denying the request and explain to the requester and us why you want to keep the subreddit. We want to ensure that subreddits are being held onto with the right intentions for growth. Responding to requests will decrease the number of people who believe the subreddit is unmoderated. Please note that responding with a simple ""no"" is not considered a valid reason. 

+ If you would like to add the mod to your team you can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq).

**Rules**

+ You may only request **one subreddit every 15 days**. Choose wisely.  Multiple requests will be auto removed.

+ If a subreddit has been banned in the last **30 days** and has over 2.5K subscribers, it is **not** eligible for request and will be denied. Anything under 2.5K will be reviewed in the normal timeframe.  

+ Accounts less than **28 days old** and without at least **100** comment karma and a verified email address will not be able to request subreddits. 

+ You may **not** use multiple accounts to request subreddits.

+ You may **not** request subreddits on behalf of other users.

+ When requesting a subreddit, you **must** send a message to the subreddit’s modmail stating your intentions for the subreddit at the time of your request. Please **link to this message** in your post. Failure to do so will result in a denial. Exceptions will be made to this rule if the sub is banned or there are no mods listed.

+ The exact criteria used in evaluating requests is left to admin discretion but can include, sitewide bans in the last 90 days, not having enough mod experience, no relevant karma for the requested subreddit or if the majority of your karma is from freekarma subs etc. More info can be found in our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq#wiki_why_was_my_request_denied.3F).

+ Multiple people can request the same subreddit, though requests are reviewed in a chronological order. If you are receiving an error when requesting a subreddit that has already been requested [please refer to the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_it_saying_that_my_link_has_already_been_submitted.3F).

+ Please **do not** ask for an exemption from the rules.

**[RULES](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/wiki/index#wiki_rules)**

1. There is a zero tolerance policy on scamming.

2. All trades must be done publicly, i.e., they must originate in a post in this subreddit and not by an unsolicited PM. Only PM private information, such as product keys, Steam keys, email addresses, etc. 

3. No NSFW / NSFL / illegal material.

4. Use [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Dogecoin is about kindness and having fun. Treat people with respect and do not take advantage of anyone.

5. No Trade Hijacking

6. No Price Policing

7. No Ads

8. No giveaways, contests, games, raffles, gambling, etc.

9. Selling bulk (2+) user accounts of any kind requires moderator approval.

---

**GUIDELINES**

* Report scammers to the mods. Do not start witch hunts.

* Check username spelling, posting history, and account age before trading.

* We highly recommend using an escrow for trades.

* Trade in small increments, and send a small test amount to verify that you’re sending to the correct address.

* It is customary for the less reputably flaired redditor to go first. **Keep in mind that only trades done on /r/Dogemarket count as your rep!**

* You can only post one post per day to prevent spam.

1103,provenlands,A Sci-Fi Sandbox Roguelike,A community for fans of the upcoming game Proven Lands being developed by thesetales.,"[Proven Lands Website](http://provenlands.com/index.html)

""Proven Lands is a unique game about exploration; about being alone and lost in an unknown sci-fi world without super powers or rocket science. Your spaceship crashed on an uncharted planet and it seems that you are the only survivor: you face a hostile desert environment, fear, hunger and thirst alone. You check your dwindling oxygen supply and survey the wreckage of spaceship parts scattered across the region. You are not a scientist, nor a soldier but a simple working class hero or heroine with a rather strange past. In the beginning you don't even know how to use most of the electronic devices that have survived the crash, but you'll learn - and soon be able to craft new ones.""
