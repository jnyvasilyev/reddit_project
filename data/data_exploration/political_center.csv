Neutral Politics is a community dedicated to evenhanded, empirical discussion of political issues. It is a space to discuss policy and the tone of political debate.

-----

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay out their respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic.

##Neutral Politics is strictly moderated.

[Our full guidelines are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines)

#Comment Rules

We expect the following from all users:

 1) **Be courteous.** Demeaning language, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

2) **Source your facts.**  If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up by linking to a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion-based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, comments without context, sarcasm, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

4) **Address the arguments, not the person.** The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.

#Submission Rules

All posts are reviewed by the moderators for compliance with these rules prior to appearing online:

A) **Ask a specific *political* question.** We do not allow overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, surveys, [requests to explain public opinion or media coverage,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/209fox/meta_the_np_community_cannot_explain_public/) posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.** The post must not be inflammatory, editorialized, leading towards a particular answer, a statement of opinion, or a request to critique your theory.

C) **Outline the issue well.** Give more than just a headline. Provide some background information.

D) **Provide sources.** Statements of fact must cite [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Nothing is ""common knowledge."" **Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected**. (Sole exception: if you cannot find specific information after a thorough online search, you may post a request for sources.)

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.**  The purpose of this forum is to discuss issues. We do not allow polls, surveys or requests for fact checking.

F) **Title the post accurately.** The title must match the contents.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question cannot be answered with facts — which includes any that are phrased in the future tense (What will/would/could happen?) — then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

**Laws of Conduct**

~**Law 0. Low Effort** 

Content that is low-effort or does not contribute to civil discussion in any meaningful way will be removed.
	
~**Law 1. Civil Discourse**

Do not engage in personal attacks or insults against any person or group. Comment on content, policies, and actions. 

Do not accuse fellow redditors of being intentionally misleading or disingenuous; assume good faith at all times.
	
~**Law 2. Submission Requirements**

a) Starter Comment - A starter comment is required within the first 30 minutes of posting any Link Post. Starter comments must contain at least 2 of these 3 elements: (1) a brief summary of the linked article in your own words, (2) your opinion of the article or topic, or (3) at least one question/discussion point for the community. 
Text Posts are subject to the same requirements as starter comments if discussing a link or links, or must be equivalently substantive if entirely original.

Ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear.
