**[Agorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism)**  is a revolutionary [left-libertarian](http://www.reddit.com/r/Agorism/wiki/index#wiki_why_is_agorism_considered_a_left-libertarian_political_philosophy.3F) political philosophy that advocates the goal of bringing about a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics.

**[Counter-economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-economics)** is the sum of all non-aggressive human action which is forbidden by the state. The counter-economy includes the free market, the black market, the ""underground economy,"" all acts of civil and social disobedience, all acts of forbidden association (sexual, racial, cross-religious), and anything else the state, at any place or time, chooses to prohibit, control, regulate, tax, or tariff. The counter-economy excludes all state-approved action (the “white market”) and the red market (violence and theft not approved by the state).

>This excellent 23 minute video gives a brief introduction to anarcho capitalist concepts and answers the most common objections, such as ""wouldn't there be constant gang warfare?""

Ayn Rand “The Objectivist Ethics:""
>“The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. No man——or group or society or government—has the right to assume the role of a criminal and initiate the use of physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense.”

[Open Objectivism] (http://www.atlassociety.org/open_objectivism_david_kelley)

>Objectivism is a body of rational knowledge rather than a fixed, closed set of doctrines like a religion. This fact is implied by the very nature of human knowledge, which Objectivism teaches us is contextual, fallible, and open-ended. The philosophy itself must therefore be open to expansion, refinement, and, if necessary, revision in the same way as any other body of knowledge, such as Newtonian physics, the theory of evolution, market economics, etc.

LibertarianDebates,Reddit: Libertarian Debates,,"**Welcome to LibertarianDebates!**

The Goal of this subreddit is:

**Improve Communication & Cooperation** This subreddit is intended specifically for improving cooperation, education, and clear communication between various schools of political ideology with libertarian ideology.

------

Debates between libertarians and non-libertarians tend to run hot on reddit, between downvote brigades and name-calling. None of that is allowed here. This is a neutral ground to actually gain an understanding of both sides of the argument. Both sides often claim that the other side would support their view if they were only informed -- this is where you can find out if that's true.

**Engagement guidelines**

* Remain civil and respectful towards diverse ideas. Posts and comments that either resort to ad-hominem attacks or are otherwise abusive will be deleted.

-We lack downvotes so this is heavily moderate. If someone is acting in this manner, then feel free to report them. If you reply in kind, then your comment will be nixed with it. Each user gets one warning then **may** be banned.

* Spammers and extreme trolls will not receive a warning. If you believe you have been banned in error or as a result of perceived moderator abuse, then do not hesitate to send us a message.

* Please read and remember [reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette) where appropriate.

* Rational and respectful debates are encouraged, however if you feel aggressive and unable to respond intelligently these posts may also be flagged.

* Don’t demonize another person’s position with your rhetoric (e.g. instead of “Why does **x** jack-off to **y**” try “Why does **x** agree with **y**”). This poisons the well of the debate and limits responses anyway.

* This subreddit is currently moderated by two libertarians and two democrats. Bans by a moderator can be appealed to the other three moderators; majority between those three rules.

Basic Rule Overview:

1. Follow all [reddit site wide rules.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) 
 * These rules are set by the admins for all of reddit and are non-negotiable. We enforce to the standards of the admins, not to our own standard.
2. Posts must be content directly and immediately relevant to libertarianism. 
 * Democrat/Republican Bad is not sufficient by itself.
3. This is an explicitly pro-liberty subreddit
 * If you're posting anti-liberty memes or comments you may be shown the door
4. Be civil and respectful to other users.
 * We get it, politics gets heated, but this sub isn't for flame wars and monkey knife fights.
5. No Meta Reddit content
 * These can be used as evidence of harassment/brigading and get us in trouble with the admins
 * This includes but is not limited to subreddit drama, screenshots, or links to posts/comments
6. Use a real descriptive title
 * Use a title that actually remarks on the content, do not use the lazy, content-free titles such as ""title"" nor ""i dunno"", nor anything of that nature which is completely general, non-specific, and lazy. Write a title which is suited to the post
7. Don't get us banned.
 * Do not post memes with a ""haha people that I hate died… haha"" punchline or allude to violent revolution or harming public figures in any way (tree of liberty, tar and feathering jokes, helicopter jokes, etc.). Don't do anything illegal, don't violate Reddit's content policy.
