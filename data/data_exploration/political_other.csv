* [Take Jury Duty! Understand Jury Nullification. Stanhope Explains.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1k4fYIUuAP8)

* It is 100% legal to openly record police in all 50 states as long as you do not physically interfere with the officer. (It's also probably wise to speak as little as possible, but DO make note of details - location, names, etc) 

* Police officers do not have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" while preforming their public duties.

* If an officer says it's illegal to record him, that officer is lying to try and trick you into shutting off the camera so you won't have proof of them violating your rights.

* Use a livestreaming app to record your videos. If your phone is seized, the police cannot delete the video because the video was never on the phone to begin with.

#The upside down planet Earth:

In the USA, [flying our flag upside-down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration#Flying_an_American_flag_upside_down) is a sign of distress; an SOS; a plea for help. From Wikipedia:

>""Flying an American flag upside down is not necessarily meant as political protest. The practice has its origin in a distress signal; displaying a flag in this manner is ""a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property""; it has been used by extension to make a statement about distress in civic, political, or other areas.""

At the rate things are going, a whole lot of nations need something like this.

CISPA,,SOPA/PIPA's Big Brother,"A meeting place to discuss new changes to CISPA bills, and to discuss the impact such legislature may have.","The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (aka. HR 3523, HR 624 or CISPA) is another attempt by US Congress to assault the Internet.  Under the guise of being necessary in America’s war against cyberattacks, the bill represents a clear assault not only on the right to a free and open internet, but an attack on the freedom of speech and privacy of all US citizens on the internet.

The new bill, found [here](https://www.eff.org/document/hr624-cispa), keeps most of the language from the original CISPA bill, with some minor adjustments.  

For a short and sweet ELI5-version of CISPA...

CISPA creates a way for the US Government and companies like Facebook, Google and others to share information with the US Government, as well as each other.   It also includes laws making it illegal to share information with people that shouldn’t know (what Bradley Manning did), to share that information among others that shouldn’t know (what WikiLeaks does), and allows for companies to trade personal information without getting in trouble.  It also allows for the US Government to spy on US citizens, to prosecute people that pirate movies, games or music, and does all of this without telling you.  You will also never know it’s happening.

The extreme version is people violating CISPA can be labeled ""domestic terrorists"" through a combination of CISPA and the Patriot Act, which is what the US Government *really* wants to do to Anonymous.

Many companies (nearly all that support CISPA, actually) stand to make money from this Act - new companies will be hired by every company on the internet for ""cybersecurity,"" as well as by the US Government, and everyone from internet providers to social networking sites will make money from the trading of information.  This is why there are so few companies fighting CISPA, and more reason for us citizens to protect our freedoms and liberties from ""Big Brother.""

You can find a guide to the bill here

Certain sites are blacklisted Reddit-wide. If you include a link to a blacklisted site, your comment will not be visible to the users. Only the mods will be able to see it, and we will remove it to clear the modqueue. This is not the sub's fault, it's Reddit's fault, so don't blame us. Please don't include blacklisted links in your comments and don't post them, because it's pointless. If your comment or post doesn't show up, that's probably why.

Among the sites on Reddit's blacklist are zerohedge, gateway pundit, bitchute, globalresearch, almost anything Russian except Moscow Times, and almost anything Reddit deems as 'Russian-backed'. We don't have a comprehensive list because they don't provide one.

""Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.

""We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."" - Karl Rove

Please keep the submissions relevant to Obama, his administration and his campaign. Neoconservatives and Obama partisans welcome as long as things remain civil.

Try to keep conspiracy theories out of here unless there's evidence backing up your claims. There are more than enough facts available to educate others about this administration's many abuses of power and military atrocities.

FairTax,,FAIRtax,"The FairTax is a taxation system that would eliminate all federal income taxes (including the alternative minimum tax, corporate income taxes, and capital gains taxes), payroll taxes (including Social Security and Medicare taxes), gift taxes, and estate taxes, replacing them with a single consumption tax on retail sales.

The FairTax includes a monthly rebate (called a “Prebate”) so that all spending up to the poverty level is tax-free, thereby making the FairTax progressive.","### Welcome! Also see the only POTUS candidate running on the FAIRtax: /r/GaryJohnson

ProChoice,,Pro-choice,For those dedicated to reproductive rights.,">A sub for pro-choice redditors who care about preserving reproductive rights for girls, women, and all pregnant people. 

Abortion bans are reproductive abuse and sex based violence on people afab. We are united in our cause to end reproductive abuse for all people who can experience pregnancy. We welcome others of opposing views when they're expressed with respect in discussions, but if you are only here to criticize, change minds, or tell people they are wrong you will be instantly banned.

---------------------------

>**Rules**



1. No anti-choice spam or propaganda
Anti-choice spam and propaganda will be removed and the poster will be banned.

2. Non pro-choice expectations
If you are non pro-choice, you're welcome to come here and ask respectful questions. Pleading with us to change our minds is not a respectful question. Calling us murderers is not respectful.
If you are genuinely interested in engaging in dialogue with us, you are expected to remain civil. This includes accepting answers you are given instead of pressing a point that has been explained. If you are not here to learn but to debate, you will be banned.
Brigading will result in an automatic ban.

3. Screenshots, direct links, & brigading
If sharing conversations from elsewhere on Reddit, take a screenshot and block out the usernames. No direct links, no brigading. Avoid making too many of these posts; if there are a lot of them, they may get removed.

4. Anti-choice article/video post requirements
Anti-choice-leaning arguments and/or articles should have a descriptive title & be made as text posts, with links within the post. If it's a video, you should describe the argument sufficiently that watching the video is not necessary for a response to be made. Make it clear why you hope to get a pro-choice perspective on it. It should remain clear that a topic is being opened for discussion. It's a subjective call and moderators may still remove content if they feel it is dominating the sub.

5. ""Pro-Choice Only"" post flair
The ""Pro-Choice Only"" post flair is meant as a way to distinguish topics meant for just fellow pro-choicers to interact on. Not every pro-choicer wishes to engage with or hear from anti-choice views on this sub. If you are anti-choice, please refrain from commenting on these posts, else your comment will be removed and you will be banned.

6. Be civil to pro-choice users
We are all a team with a goal in common. Therefore, please act accordingly. If you have a problem with another user, work it out privately. Name calling and personal attacks are also not tolerated. Let's keep this subreddit related to gaining abortion rights.
You're also expected to behave in a way that won't embarrass our sub in a screenshot and cause more brigading. Don't start a brigade.

7. Civility towards non-pro-choice users
There are people who genuinely want to engage in dialogue with us. Non-pro-choice users are expected to remain respectful & civil, & in return, we expect pro-choicers to return the civility. If a non-pro-choice user breaks the rule, users are allowed to enact 'Thunderdome' where pro-choicers can decide if they wish to continue to remain civil or not. This can be used ONLY regarding non-pro-choice users who decide to be hostile. Do not call 'Thunderdome' solely because a user is non-pro-choice.

8. Banned words/comparisons for non pro-choicers
Non pro-choicers are banned from using the following words and comparisons: murder, Nazi, Holocaust, genocide, slavery, Hitler, slut, whore, selfish, evil, etc. as well as iterations &/or coupled words to be suggestive of the aforementioned words and comparisons. This list is not exhaustive. Any such usage will result in an immediate ban. Words found to be within the spirit of this rule may result in a ban & is up to moderator discretion.

9. Polls must have a ""show results"" option
Or some iteration thereof. We get lots of prolifers who lurk the sub and like to see poll results. Please provide an option for our lurkers and those that do not wish to participate or are not the target participants.

10. Gender Inclusive
Please be mindful of the presence of all genders on this sub, whether cis, trans, non-binary, etc.
We are here to advocate for the abortion rights of all people with a uterus & as such disrespect towards a person's gender identity will not be tolerated.

11. No ""paper abortion"" type posts
Abortion is a medical procedure. Child support is a parental rights issue.
Conflating the two is insulting to bodily rights.
Likewise, rights for the non-pregnant partner to stop or force an abortion do not coincide with bodily rights. And ""having a say"" is a relationship issue. 
Neither topic will be tolerated here.

12. No Unsafe/Unreliable Abortion Suggestions
We do not allow suggestions that people abort using herbs, folk remedies, or DIY methods.
This does not include safe and reliable self managed methods like medication abortion. Additionally, though we do not recommend menstrual extraction or manual vacuum aspiration without a doctor’s supervision, we do not ban references to these options as they have a low risk of infection and perforation.

13. Discussion of later abortions should be well-informed
Somehow the rarest abortions get the most discussion.  If you want to share your thoughts on abortion later in pregnancy, we expect that you you read and understand [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/uxvpvk/later_abortion_megathread/) post, and show that you're making a good faith effort to understand it.  It's a long post, because it's a complex issue!

>**What is Social Democracy?**

> From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy):


> **Social democracy is** a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods.

> **Alternatively, social democracy is** defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.

> **The Social Democracy subreddit is home to social democrats of both types - and all inbetween.**

***

###### [](#h6-red)

>**Who Are We?**

>In a time of political gridlock, populism vs. non-populism, ineffectual government systems, and radicals calling for revolution, Social Democrats look to the worlds most prosperous nations as a model to pursue.

>There are several different forms of Social Democracy, but we have consensus on several key issues. We believe in reducing poverty; defeating wealth inequality; providing universal services such as healthcare, education, child care, & unions; supporting small businesses; taxing the wealthiest; and making sure everyone has an equal opportunity in life, regardless of their birth lottery.

>The nations of Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and New Zealand, which have all had Social Democratic Parties lead the nation within the past twenty years, are among the most flourishing nations in any international index, — whether it be happiness, quality of living, healthcare, & education.

>The halcyon days of Einar Gerhardsen, who saved Norway following World War II; Clement Atlee, who created the NHS; Tage Erlander, who led Sweden for a democratically elected 23 years; or Willy Brandt, who guided West Germany through the most strenuous period in human history, — we look to all these political icons as an answer to our future.

>To anyone new, feel welcome to engage in discussion, regardless of your political orientation! We welcome all, — from Communist to Conservative. We want you to know that we are not radicals, we are not extremists, we do not demand revolution or state take over, we simply want for everyone to experience economic freedom, personal liberty, & justice.

1) Don't be a jerk. Please follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

2) Posts relating to the 2016 elections are strongly encouraged. Editorialized links and other opinion pieces are fine, but try to not use sensationalized titles. 

3) Posts related to the 114th Congress, statewide elections, and other important developments relating to potential candidates are also okay. If you want to post something but you aren't sure if it's relevant, post it anyway and we can decide if it should stay or be moved to a different sub. If a submission leads to some sort of meaningful discussion, it is *very* unlikely to be removed.

4) Feel free to speculate and make predictions, but try to back up those predictions with sources.

5) It's okay to post 100% in support of a specific candidate. If you want a diversity of views in this subreddit, contribute and vote accordingly. This is a place for everything having to do with the election.

6) No advertising *without permission*. That includes for products, candidates, blogs, businesses, or subreddits. Please ask the mods for permission.

7) Do not change the title of an article to include your opinion. Writing an editorial text post that includes the article as the main focus is also silly - if you want to discuss an article, submit the article as a link-post and include your opinions in a comment.

Like the Roman Republic under Caesar Augustus, the American Republic is rapidly sliding into a system that limits individual liberty, that limits influence of its citizens, that produces ever greater separation between rich and poor, and pursues permanent war for the benefit of a tiny fraction of Americans. Oppression is growing as large corporations and government work together to limit personal freedom.

Some signs of this descent into tyranny are the:

- de facto repeal of Constitutionally guaranteed rights

- militarization of police forces

- smothering of dissent

- control of the Internet and the media by the government or private proxies

- Imperial power of life and death in the hands of the President

*""Unfortunately, you’ve grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that’s at the root of all our problems. Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works. They’ll warn that tyranny always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave, and creative, and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can’t be trusted.""*

IWantOut,,I Want Out: Information for people who want to expatriate,Welcome to r/IWantOut: Reddit's expatriate community. Please take a look at the sidebar for some tips for getting the most out of it.,"#*Welcome to r/IWantOut, Reddit's expat subreddit. Please read the sidebar for general advice and helpful links.*

If you want out of wherever you live, we're here to help.

Got questions? Want advice and experience from people who have gotten out or are still trying? Have a good tip or a success story to tell? Just need support? No matter where you're from or where you're going, you're welcome here.

###☞This is a space to discuss strategies and advice for legal immigration, NOT to debate about refugees, undocumented migrants, the ethics/wisdom of various immigration policies, etc. Posts and comments that stray from the subject of legal immigration will be removed and you may be warned or banned depending on the severity of the offense. Report rule violations. If you have any questions, feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.

_____________

**★ RULES ★**

1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. **This is not a political subreddit**. Politics might be the reason you want out, which is perfectly fine. Instead of writing 3 paragraphs about what specifically you don't like, write ""I disagree with the politics"" and then talk about what you're looking for. It'll help prevent purely political comments.

2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.

3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.
We do allow ""-> anywhere"" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.

4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). **The mods will not approve posts which do not pass the title format restrictions**.  

5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask. In general, posting links to things is welcome as comments on relevant posts, but we rarely allow them as posts. In order to prevent our community from being inundated with survey requests, **we universally do NOT allow surveys**. If you ask the mods to post your survey, you will be politely declined. If you post anyway, you will be permanently banned.

6. Please report rule violations. If you notice a violation of Rules 1, 2, 3, or 5, please **REPORT** it. Please do not send links of these posts/comments to modmail. **The one exception to this is Rule 4: Observe the title format, please send Rule 4 violations to modmail**. We don't accept reports on the title format, because we've found that the majority of those reports are incorrect as people don't understand the title format. Instead, we ask that you send links to modmail, so that if you're incorrect, we can at least explain why you're incorrect so that hopefully in the future, you'll know what to look out for.


**★ PROTIPS ★**

* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.

* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions – immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, ""I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,"" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.

* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.

* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.

The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.

Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.

***Submission Rules***
-
New submissions will not appear until approved by a moderator.

**Wiki Guide:** [Tips On Writing a Successful Political Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/wiki/posts)


Please observe the following rules:

-
**1. Submissions should be an impartial discussion prompt + questions.**

* Keep it civil, no political name-calling.

* Do not ask [loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question) or [rhetorical questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question).

* No personal opinions/proposals or posts designed to support a certain conclusion. Either offer those as a comment or post them to r/PoliticalOpinions.

**2. Provide some background and context. Offer substantive avenues for discussion.**

* Avoid highly speculative posts, all scenarios should within the realm of reasonable possibility.

* Do not request users help you with an argument, educate you, or perform research for you.

* No posts that boil down to: DAE, ELI5, CMV, TIL, AskX, ""Thoughts?"", ""Discuss!"", or ""How does this affect the election?""

**3. Everything in the post should be directly related to a political issue.**

* No meta discussion about reddit, subreddits, or redditors.

* Potentially non-politics: Law, sociology, philosophy, celebrities, news, etc.

* We are not a link subreddit. Don't just post links to news, blogs, surveys, videos, etc.

**4. Formatting and housekeeping things:**

* The title should match the post. Don't use tags like `[Serious]`

* Check to make sure another recent post doesn't already cover that topic.

* Don't use all-caps. Format for readability: paragraphs, punctuation, and link containers.

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts should be regarding U.S. politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly. 

     Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, leftists, etc!), but please keep posts civil. 

2. **Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.** 

 **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.

 If it's isn't funny (or at least trying to be), we'll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)

 If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. 

 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a ""flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn"" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.


3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** 

    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. 

4. **Images & short GIFs only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.

    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  

    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within ""allowed"" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** 

 Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. 

 Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  

6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, including use of ""tard"" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. 

  If you're intentionally trolling, including ""google games,"" you will be banned. 

7. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. 

 ___7b.___  **No ""Meta"" Posts.**

 Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.


8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 

9. **No pointing at offsite resources**

  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.

  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.

###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderation actions are done at each moderator's own discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message and we'll take a look at why you were banned for you. Contrition will play in your favor if you were banned for violating our rules. 

* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)

When you make a post, you pick a topic to debate on and which side each team will take.

The teams are arbitrary and are not meant to represent any political party in particular.


**Downvotes are for comments that don't follow proper debate etiquette.  Don't just mass downvote the other team for debating like they're supposed to.**

**[Read this(what not to do)](http://ninjapirate.com/logic.html)**

Jargon:

R = Red

B = Blue


When making a post, signify the team that will take the 'affirmative' position in the argument followed by the argument statement.

Example:

R:  Cats are better pets than dogs.

This would mean that Red team is arguing in support of cats being better pets than dogs.

Welcome,

This sub is dedicated to organizing roundtable discussions (perhaps over Google+) after each upcoming presidential debate with Gary Johnson, Dennis Kucinich, Jill Stein, Ron Paul, Russ Feingold and others where Romney and Obama's comments are analyzed & critiqued.

It is our hope that discussions featuring influential figures of various political leanings will help amplify a variety of viewpoints that otherwise might not gain exposure through traditional media outlets.

If you share the belief that our two-party system is in dire need of reform, join us as we attempt to convene intelligent discussions about the critical issues that face our country.

USANews,,USA News,,"**OUR RULES**:

#***MAKE NO MORE THAN 10 SUBMISSIONS IN ANY 24-HOUR PERIOD.***

*Moderators have discretion to remove submissions, comments or users that violate these rules.*

Don’t post submissions that are not about news pertaining to the US or its territories. (Consider the subreddit title: ”***USA***News”.)

**Submission titles**: Don’t editorialize titles. Stick to the published title as much as possible. Ask what you want or make your point in a comment, *not* in the submission title. Avoid “clickbait”ish titles. Don’t use a title that does not concisely summarize the submission. (People should be able to know what it is about without clicking on the submission.) DO NOT USE ALL CAPITAL LETTERS IN THE TITLE (even if that's the way it appears as published). ***NO EMOJIS IN TITLES!***

Don’t post highly partisan political news or advocacy posts. 
[Submissions or comments that ask readers to make a donation, sign a petition, or spread the word about a particular cause are considered *advocacy posts*, and will be removed by the moderators.]

***DON'T SPAM*** (This includes self-promoting submissions/comments.)  ***Spammers may be banned, even if no prior warning has been given.***

No blogspam

Don’t post spammy, unoriginal content 

***DO NOT SOLICIT DONATIONS FOR ANY CAUSE, POST PETITIONS OR CALL FOR CONCERTED ACTION*** (These sorts of posts are considered *advocacy posts* and will be removed. Please down vote and report these posts.)

**Don’t post archived articles (or reddit.com [or redd.it] links); use the original source**

Don’t post articles that are not true, even if it is “satire” or “humor”. **Don't post articles that are “satire” or “humor”.**

No subreddit drama. (Don’t post about having something removed from, or being banned from, any subreddit.)

Don’t post unnecessarily rude, antagonistic, ad hominem, or off-topic comments

Comments that detract from meaningful, civil, intelligent discussion (including trolling, name-calling, bigoted and ad hominem comments) will be removed. ***DON’T TROLL***. ***NO PERSONAL ATTACKS. (Attack the message, not the messenger.)*** Those so commenting may be banned, without prior warning. *”But he/she/whomsoever did it” isn’t an excuse.* Rather than responding to such comments, use the report button to report them to the moderators (providing a link).

**DON’T STALK**. 

Don’t bring disputes from another subreddit into this one.

**Don’t use gratuitous and/or unnecessary profanity**

**DO NOT POST ANYTHING WITH (OR SOLICIT) PERSONAL INFORMATION**, whether of yourself or others. They will be removed subject to moderator discretion. 

**DON’T COMPLAIN ABOUT A NEWS** ***SOURCE***. (Comments about submission *content* are fine. Comments like ""NY Times/National Review: LOL"" will be removed.)

**NO DIRECT SUBMISSIONS THAT LINK ONLY TO AN IMAGE OR VIDEO** (Imgur, Tinypic, YouTube, i.redd.it, v.redd.it, snapchat.com,
etc.). -- Post an article, and submit the image or video as a comment.

Bot-generated comments will be removed and the bot banned.

#***USERS WHO HAVE DISABLED MODERATOR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING THEIR POSTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO POST.***

***

#***IF REPORTING SOMETHING, be specific about what rule is being violated.*** ""See the sidebar"" or something like that is of little value.

***

#***PAYWALL ISSUES?*** There is such a thing as a library, or a newsstand, or even a subscription.  (**Handy Helpful Hint**: you can often get around the paywall by doing an internet search for the title.)
