*****

Feel free to speak your mind, as a conservative, without fear of being banned.  Non-conservatives may ask questions and engage in polite conversation with conservatives on a limited basis, but should avoid heated debate or downvoting our users based on opinion.   

This is not, in fact, a debate subreddit... so if you are a liberal you are not welcome to constantly try to challenge conservatives here.  There are other subreddits where you may do that.

 Please do not use excessive profanity and heated rhetoric.
*****


*****

Rules:

1) Personal Attacks

Avoid personal attacks and insults. Be civil at all times. Spirited discussion and disagreement is encouraged, but insults and personal attacks degrade the quality of discussion on the subreddit and will not be tolerated.

2) Bigotry

You may not make racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or otherwise bigoted comments in the sub.

3) Reddiquete

Follow reddit [terms of service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) and [Reddiquette](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)

4) Voting and Complaints of Bias

Do not engage in blind downvoting of comments and submissions on a partisan basis. Do not complain that articles are biased.

5)  Liberal Talking Points

Do not make comments consisting entirely of liberal talking points. For example: Do not make the case for socialism, universal health care or UBI. Do not use the subreddit to shill for liberal candidates/politicians.

6) Conservative Bashing

There are a lot of places on reddit where bashing Conservatism is allowed and even encouraged. This is not one of them.

7) Trolling

Do not engage in trollish behavior. Avoid excessive profanity.

8)  Use Your Words

Posts and comments consisting of one word, an image, meme or just an emoji are highly discouraged as we seek to foster debate and conversation. As such, they are subject to removal at the mods' discretion.

9) Complaints About Benign Submissions

Do not complain in the comment section about submissions that are benign in nature. If there is something posted that is truly inappropriate, message the moderators or hit the report button.

10) Complaints About the Subreddit

Complaints about the subreddit should be directed to [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/conservatives)

11) Posts and comments about transgenderism

Posts and comments about transgender individuals, news stories referencing them, any sexualization or mutilation of children by individuals who identify as part of this group, or governmental or institutional policies about them will no longer be allowed on this subreddit, because certain redditors consider anything remotely negative posted about that group to be ""promoting hate"", and the admins agree with them.  Any such posts or comments should be taken to a different platform on which free speech is still possible.




  

[If you are a liberal joining us](https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/wiki/newliberals).  

If you have issues with anyone violating the rules, please message the moderators.  Thank you.

r/Objectivism is a philosophy for life on earth. Its purpose is to teach people to lead happy, successful lives full of self-esteem through rational thinking.

#Rules
* Follow Reddit's sitewide rules [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)

*  Posts should be relevant to Ayn Rand, her works, Objectivism, the Objectivist movement.

* Be civil, intense debate is welcome, insults are not.

#Objectivism in detail
Ayn Rand explains her philosophy ""on one foot.""

""At a sales conference at Random House, preceding the publication of Atlas Shrugged, one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essence of my philosophy while standing on one foot. I did as follows:

*  Metaphysics: Objective Reality 
*  Epistemology: Reason
*  Ethics: Self-interest 
*  Politics: Capitalism

If you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 

1. “Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed” or “Wishing won’t make it so.” 

2. “You can’t eat your cake and have it, too.” 

3. “Man is an end in himself.” 

4. “Give me liberty or give me death.”

If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of your convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of your life. But to hold them with total consistency—to understand, to define, to prove and to apply them—requires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophy cannot be discussed while standing on one foot—nor while standing on two feet on both sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical position today, particularly in the field of politics.

My philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:

Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.

Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.

Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.

The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’s rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.""

**Differences from /r/objectivism**

1. The moderators there have a history of banning people, particularly those who disagree with them on what constitutes Objectivism and ""objectivism"" (their use, note lower-case ""o""). Bans have tended to be made inconsistently and unpredictably.

2. The moderators there have a history of operating large-scale deceptions using many alternative reddit accounts (""sock puppets"") (more info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Trueobjectivism/comments/1psjku/major_update_on_rtrueobjectivism/)).

3. The moderators there are not actually Objectivists, but support some mix between anarchism and Objectivism. (Objectivism is Ayn Rand's philosophy, and it repudiates anarchism. See: [Anarchism](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/anarchism.html) at the Ayn Rand Lexicon.)

4. The moderators there created it to be a community for supporters of TAS. This alignment was not revealed until 5 years after the fact, a bait-and-switch. [See here for documentation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Trueobjectivism/comments/29wfb4/statement_from_robjectivism_clarifying_its_purpose/) TAS is a minority faction created by David Kelley after his dispute with Leonard Peikoff (and ARI) on the nature of moral judgement. /r/trueobjectivism is not officially aligned with either ARI or TAS, but most people here do side with Peikoff and do support ARI.
