#Wiki:

This is a transparent subreddit, where users are vigilant about reporting and moderators are active.

Please see the **[/r/DebateCommunism Wiki](/r/DebateCommunism/wiki/index)** for information pertaining to moderation, voting, strikes, flair, quality, archives, etc.

#Rules:

1. **Follow the post guidelines**. They're at the top of the subreddit.

3. **Don't make badposts.** Badposts include posts on the [Frequent Topics List](/r/DebateCommunism/wiki/index/frequenttopics), ***title-only posts***, ***posts that just link to a video / an article***, and ***one-sentence posts***. Read the post guidelines for info on how to write a good post.

4. **Go to /r/communism101** if you have a basic question rather than a debate prompt.

# Rules that we shouldn't have to spell out

2. **Debate in good faith**, with the aim of either learning something that changes your position, or learning how strong your position really is. Add to the discussion. 

5. **Engage with your opponents respectfully.** Be charitable, don't misrepresent, don't use personal attacks, don't be sarcastic.

3. **Make sure your posts are relevant to the subreddit.** Complaining about other subreddits does *not* come under this umbrella. ^We're ^sick ^of ^removing ^posts ^where ^people ^complain ^about ^being ^banned ^from ^/r/LateStageCapitalism ^or ^/r/communism ^or ^wherever. ^Stop ^it, ^please. ^Go ^somewhere ^else.

4. **No racism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, or homophobia.** This includes usage of slurs and discriminatory language, as well as fascists.

5. **If the OP's post is directed towards a specific political group, do not make any top-level replies if the prompt is not directed towards you.**

#Explanation of flairs

We flair posts so regulars can identify what posts are worth responding to, and to set the tone for any discussion. Here are a few:

* ""Unmoderated"" - a moderator has not yet read the post.

* ""FAQ"" - posts which have been frequently made on this subreddit in the past.

* ""Poorly written"" - posts which blatantly do not conform to posting guidelines.

* ""Bad faith"" - the author of the post is not approaching the discussion in good faith, and debates with them may be frustrating.
