# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|
|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|
|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as ""I got banned from \/r/\_\_\_"" or ""This got removed from \/r/\_\_\_"" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |
|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|
|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|
|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|
|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any ""comments section,"" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden. [Read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10.3A_no_social_media_or_electronic_messaging_content.).

[New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)



* You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?
 
* Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).
 
#Posting rules#
 
1. **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
1. **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g ""TIL xyz is a great movie"").

1. **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.
 
1. No politics, soapboxing, or agenda based submissions. This includes (but is not limited to) submissions related to: 
   1. Recent political issues and politicians
   1. Social and economic issues (including race/religion/gender)
   1. Environmental issues
   1. Police misconduct
 
1. **No misleading claims**. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. Titles **must** begin with ""TIL ...""
   1. Make them **descriptive, concise and specific** (e.g. not ""TIL something interesting about bacon"").
   1. Titles must be able to **stand on their own** without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.
   1. *""TIL about ..."" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word ""about"").*
   1. *""TIL how to ..."" posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
   1. *""TIL the definition of a word..."" Word definitions/translations/origins are not appropriate here*

1. No submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. ""TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22"").

1.  **All NSFW links must be tagged** *(including comments).*

Showerthoughts,Showerthoughts,A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.,"## About

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

""Showerthought"" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. 

**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) before submitting.**

**Please read [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) before messaging the moderators.**

## Rules  

- **1. All content must be original and unique.**    
Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on Reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_all_content_must_be_original_and_unique.)

- **2. All posts must be showerthoughts.**     
For an explanation of what a showerthought actually is (and is not), please read [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).

- **3. Your entire thought must be in the title.**     
You may include examples, explanations, or further information in the body section, but all posts to /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own as nothing but a title.

- **4. No shower ""observations.""**    
Thoughts directly related to being in the shower (or anything related to the bathroom) will be removed. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22shower_observations..22)

- **5. No jokes, puns, wordplay, or submissions which are dependent on definitions, mechanisms, or oddities in language.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.22wordplay.3F.22)

- **6. No ""life pro-tips"" or advice.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22life_pro-tips.22_or_advice.)

- **7. No posts about Reddit or its functions.**    
Thoughts pertaining to or mentioning Reddit are not allowed.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_commentaries_on_reddit_or_its_functions.)

- **8. No posts relating to politics, social justice, or religion.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_posts_relating_to_politics.2C_religion.2C_or_social_justice.)

- **9. Don't be a jerk.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_don.27t_be_a_jerk.)

> [**Please see the complete rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules)

> Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene.

> **This subreddit is moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not ""[let the votes decide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)."" We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a high-traffic subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#1. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#2. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#4. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#7. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#9. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.
](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)

#10. No Self Promotion

* *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.""* - Confucius

* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.

####Welcome to /r/EarthPorn, reddit's premiere landscape photography subreddit. 

[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

######Please post your own images here, but before you do, kindly read and adhere to the following rules:

###### **Rules:**
Submissions must be:

###### A photograph.
No Paintings, illustrations, gifs, videos, or interactive images.

###### A photograph you took (OC) 
or one which you can provide the [original source for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_this_is_my_first_time_submitting.2C_what_should_i_know.3F) Do not rehost non-OC images to reddit or imgur. Failure to provide the photographers name or the original source of the image can result in a ban. 

###### A single image
Albums may be posted in the comments.
Panoramas, Image Stacks, Composites, and images edited via Photoshop or similar software are allowed.

###### An image featuring a natural landscape
Images must have visible land. Images with humans, machines, boats, roads, airplanes, farms, animals, buildings, or other human-made objects in them [will be removed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_what_types_of_images_are_allowed.3F)

###### An unsilhouetted image
Images where details in the landscape are not visible due to silhouetting will be removed.

###### No photos taken illegally
This includes flying your drone in a no-fly zone. Please respect local laws and access closures!


###### **Title Requirements:**
You submission title must contain the following:

###### The location of the area in the photo.
When it comes to location, the more specific the better. If you wish to not disclose the location you should at the very least name the state/country. Rule of thumb for naming only the location (e.g. a lake, mountain): if one can find the place immediately by searching it in google it's fine. For possibly ambiguous locations add state/country for safety.

###### The resolution of the image in pixel format.
For example, an image taken on an iPhone 6 would have a resolution of [3264x2448]

###### The photographers name.
If you took the photo use [OC]. OC submitters will be reward with different camera flairs based on number of OC submissions.

###### Do not include your device name in the title.
Feel free to add photography details such as camera, lens, and settings, as a comment.

###### Do not ask for upvotes in your title.
A complete list of subreddit rules are found in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index)

---

###### **Comment Rules:**

Hate Speech, Abusive remarks, homophobia, and the like have no place on this subreddit, and will be removed on sight.

Please contribute to the discussion positively; constructive criticism is fine, but if you don't like a picture and you wish to voice your opinion please refrain from abusing the photographer/submitter.

---

###### **Other important rules:**

EarthPorn is not a catch-all subreddit. Images that are submitted here are individually reviewed for compliance with our subreddit rules. If your submission is removed, a moderator should advise which of our network of SFWPorn subreddits would be a more appropriate place to submit.

* Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to ""fix"" the colors of an image or remove a watermark.
* Non-OC submissions are restricted to [one per day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2pd9kj/a_small_rule_change_for_earthporn/)**
* Regarding reposts: [Submissions are considered reposts if they have been submitted in the last 2 years or if they have received more than 20,000 karma when they were previously submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/rkyp98/rules_update_for_2022/) 
* Circlejerky/sandbagging/pandering titles may be removed.
* If you have any questions check out the [**wiki**](/r/EarthPorn/wiki/).
* Breaking multiple rules will result in a ban.

* Current abusive circlejerks:
    * Melt circlejerk (on grilled cheese posts)

Please use a civil tone and assume good faith when entering a conversation.

3. **Prohibited**  
Promotional posts, comments & flairs, media-only posts, personalized recommendation requests incl. ‘Should I read …?’, ‘What’s that book?’ posts, sales links, piracy, plagiarism, low quality book lists, unmarked spoilers (instructions for spoiler tags are in the sidebar), sensationalist headlines, novelty accounts, low effort content. *Please see extended rules for appropriate alternative subreddits, like /r/suggestmeabook, /r/whatsthatbook, etc. or check out our [Related Subreddits](/r/books/wiki/relatedsubreddits).*

nottheonion,"Sadly, this is not the Onion.",For true stories that you could have sworn were from The Onion.,"**Official Reddit Partner Community**

*Review current posts to avoid reposting.*

For **true stories** that that you could have sworn were from [The Onion](http://theonion.com/).

[](/spikeholdup) Please note that we are an editorialized subreddit devoted to showcasing articles that **read like satire**. Most submissions do not make the cut, so please do not treat removals under Rule 2 as personal attacks: They are simply the results of our content model.

[](/starlightrage)
##See something that breaks our rules?  

###Use the report button and remember to choose a reason for reporting.

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be ""Oniony"". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

LifeProTips,Life Pro Tips,Tips that improve your life in one way or another.,"**What is a Life Pro Tip?**

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.

**Keep in mind that giving someone advice is not the same as giving someone a LPT.** Advice is offering someone guidance or offering someone a recommendation.

Examples of advice:

 “Always be prepared to leave your employer because they are prepared to leave you.”

“A marriage proposal should not come as a big surprise, despite what you may have seen in the movies.”

**Keep in mind that an aphorism is not a LPT.**

An aphorism is a a short clever saying that is intended to express a general truth or a concise statement of a principle.

Examples of aphorisms:

""A barking dog never bites.""

""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""

""All stones are broken stones.""

---

**RULES:**

1. No rude, offensive, racist, homophobic, sexist, aggressive or hateful posts/comments.
2. Posts must begin with ""LPT"" or ""LPT Request” and be flaired. Titles must be descriptive. The tip and the problem it solves must be explained thoroughly.  Request posts are Friday's only.
3. Tag tips for adult audiences as NSFW.
4. Do not post tips that could be considered common sense, common courtesy, unethical, or illegal.
5. Do not post tips that are based on spurious, unsubstantiated, or anecdotal claims.
6. Posts concerning the following are not allowed: religion, politics, relationships, law and legislation, parenting, driving, medicine or hygiene (including mental health).
7. Do not post tips in reaction to other posts. Reposts may be removed.
8. Do not post tips that are advertisements or recommendations of products or services.
9. Posts or comments that troll and/or do not substantially contribute to the discussion may be removed.

Note that moderators will use their own discretion to remove any post that they believe is low-quality or not considered a LPT.

---

**BANNING POLICY:**

Bans are given out immediately and serve as a warning.

You may appeal this initial ban by messaging the moderators and agreeing not to break the rules again. 
You must acknowledge the rule you broke!

> **gadget** *(noun)* - a small mechanical / electrical device or tool, especially an ingenious or novel one. [Check out our giveaway calendar!](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/6?cid=Z2FkZ2V0c21vZHNAZ21haWwuY29t)




### Please read the rules:

1. Submissions must be explicitly about a single gadget. (Posts about software or tech companies will be removed. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).

2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with. Native advertising and ""advertorials"" are also not allowed.

3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: 
   - The article must be from a white listed source.
   - The article must be about the gadget, not the company, its business practices, or delivery dates etc.
   - The submitter must not be affiliated with the campaign, company or website

4. No direct image links.

5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles. 

6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.

However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. 

11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. 

12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).

## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**


1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post GIFs that have already appeared on /r/GIFs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post GIFs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to GIF formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  †**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/wiki/rule9)

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**† We may allow multiple cuts and/or GIFs up to a minute long depending on the popularity of a post. Sound, text boxes, and GIFs that heavily depend on captions are still not allowed.**

&nbsp;

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/GIFs.

#####Welcome to r/Futurology

A subreddit devoted to the field of Future(s) Studies and evidence-based speculation about the development of humanity, technology, and civilization.

#####Posting Rules

>
1. Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.
2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.
3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.
4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.
5. Bots require moderator permission to operate
6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.
7. Account age: >1 day to comment, >5 days to submit content
8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed
9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.
10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines
11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission
12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content
13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

#[**Rules for Submissions**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules)

I. **Titles**

1. All titles must begin with [PsBattle:](/submit/?title=PsBattle:%20)

    This *is* case sensitive and must include a space after the colon.

2. Titles must *objectively describe* the subject of the image.

    2.1. No jokes, editorialising, or giving background info. The quality of the image is more important than how catchy the title is. 

    2.2. Requests, such as ""Please photoshop me or my friend"", are not permitted. Please review our suggestions below for an appropriate subreddit.

    2.3. Questions, such as ""Where else could he be?"" are not permitted.

    2.4. No personal anecdotes or mention of your connection to the image.

    2.5. No clichés such as ""this has potential"", ""make this epic"", ""This cat/dog/baby"", or ""My friend/daughter/son..."".  

II. **Image content**

1. Submissions must be a *direct* link to a *single* image. Albums and paneled/tiled images will be removed.

2. Images must be reasonable quality.

    2.1. Images must be at least 600x600 pixels (360,000 pixels total).
 
    2.2. No [technically low-quality images.](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules#wiki_reasons_for_these_rules)

    2.3. Images must be relatively well framed, and free from noise, blur, and distortion.

3. No disallowed image content.

    3.1. No photos of tv screens / computer monitors / physical pictures / billboards / magazines, etc.

    3.2. Images centered around text or signs may be removed.

    3.3. No phone / computer screenshots.

4. Images that have already been photoshopped may be removed, including images with watermarks, logos, or added text.

5. Images that have active threads, or have been photoshopped here, or elsewhere, may be removed.

6. If the mods believe that someone would object to having their image photoshopped or shared (no snapchats), it may be removed.

7. Sexually suggestive and overly gory submissions may be removed. 

**Deleting submissions with work in the comment section is not tolerated, and will result in a permanent submission ban.**

#[**Rules for Commenting**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content. 

Comments that are cliché, karma chains, not an original photoshop, memes, reaction gifs, upvote gifs, or off topic are *subject to removal by the moderators without notification.*

NSFW tags must be used *generously*.

**Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.**

[*Link to comment rules page.*](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

---

**Voting**

Please upvote based on quality of work. **Lazy** shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh.

Please do not downvote *submissions* just because they do not have obvious potential.

---

Please [report](http://i.imgur.com/DYBtk.png) inappropriate content to the mods.

A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)
> ### 1.  Use proper formatting: (1) All titles must start with TIFU. (2) All posts must have at least 750 characters in the body. (3) All posts must have a ""TL;DR summary"" at the end.

######[](#space)
> ### 2.  Posts must be about you.  Today **I** fucked up.  Not your grandma, not some dude you saw in the newspaper.  

######[](#space)
> ### 3.  **Must be your fault**. Being a victim of something is not TIFU. Getting robbed, scammed, attacked, cheated on, etc, is not TIFU

######[](#space)
> ### 4.  No overly vulgar posts.  Eg:  No pissing/&#8203;shitting your pants.  No incest/&#8203;rape&#8203;/&#8203;minors/&#8203;bestiality.  No death of animals.  No glorification of major crimes.

######[](#space)
> ### 5.  Not a fuckup.  No humblebrags or stories that have zero consequences and don't go anywhere.  Eg ""tifu by sexy sex"".  Moderator discretion.    

######[](#space)
> ### 6.  Be civil.  No racism/&#8203;bigotry/&#8203;homophobia/&#8203;transphobia.  No personal attacks on other users, no name-calling.  No low-effort ""this didn't happen"" type comments.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/wiki/rule6)

######[](#space)
> ### 7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this."" These examples are by no means comprehensive, just don't self promote.

## Notes
#### **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story, you can start it with ""TIFUpdate"".

Antivaxx rhetoric or participation on antivaxx subreddits is cause for a ban from this subreddit.

**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, or a photo essay, of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.","**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, video, or photo essay of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.     

**PLEASE READ OUR SEVEN QUICK RULES:**

1: Photos and videos must be over 25 years old. 

2: Please put the year or decade in title, otherwise your post will be removed. 

3: Spam, racist, homophobic, sexist and offensive comments, as well as brigading, consistent reposting and shitposting, will result in a lifetime ban. Offensive comments include anything about pimping, about people's moms and scoring women. Nobody cares about your sexual impulses, least of all the OP.

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed. 

6: All posts must feature a person.  

7: We reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't showcase historical coolness. This includes photos, which are not obviously retro and portraits of famous young women doing nothing but posing.

r/listentothis is a place to discover music by new or overlooked artists[.](/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/csqiqnd?context=2) *Not a place to bury music you don't like*. Keep an open mind, try something new, and you will discover something great. 

All genres are welcome, but bots will remove mainstream music submissions and frequently reposted artists. **All self-promotion and personal association go in the [melting pot!](//goo.gl/8grHEC)**

Check the **[listening apps](//goo.gl/2ySjbl)** for tools to listen outside of reddit. Listentothis is best experienced with **[RES installed](//goo.gl/Qnm9B4)** and styles enabled.

No matter what your taste, there should be something here that you will love.  If you have something under-appreciated that you'd like to share, please read our rules and submit a link!

philosophy,philosophy,/r/philosophy: the portal for public philosophy,"###[/r/philosophy Rules and Guidelines](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14pn2k9/welcome_to_rphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/?)

####Hover or Tap Each Rule for Full Details

##Posting Rules
1. ###All posts must be about philosophy. 
>To learn more about what is and is not considered philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit, see our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq). Posts must be about philosophy proper, rather than only tangentially connected to philosophy. Exceptions are made only for posts about philosophers with substantive content, e.g. news about the profession or interviews with philosophers.

2. ###All posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis.
>Posts must not only have a philosophical subject matter, but must also present this subject matter in a developed manner. At a minimum, this includes: stating the problem being addressed; stating the thesis; stating how the thesis contributes to the problem; outlining some alternative answers to the same problem; saying something about why the stated thesis is preferable to the alternatives; anticipating some objections to the stated thesis and giving responses to them. These are just the minimum requirements. Posts about well-trod issues (e.g. free will) require more development.

3. ###Questions belong in /r/askphilosophy. 
> /r/philosophy is intended for philosophical material and discussion. Please direct all questions to /r/askphilosophy. 

4. ###Post titles cannot be questions and must describe the philosophical content of the posted material.
>Post titles cannot contain questions, even if the title of the linked material is a question. This helps keep discussion in the comments on topic and relevant to the linked material. Post titles must describe the philosophical content of the posted material, cannot be unduly provocative, click-baity, unnecessarily long or in all caps.


5. ###Audio/video links require abstracts.
>All links to either audio or video content require abstracts of the posted material, posted as a comment in the thread. Abstracts should make clear what the linked material is about and what its thesis is. Users are also strongly encouraged to post abstracts for other linked material. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/abstracts) for an example of a suitable abstract.

6. ###All posts must be in English. 
>All posts must be in English. Links to Google Translated versions of posts are not allowed. 

7. ###Links behind paywalls or registration walls are not allowed. 
>Posts must not be behind any sort of paywall or registration wall. If the linked material requires signing up to view, even if the account is free, it is not allowed. Google Drive links and link shorteners are not allowed.

8. ###Meta-posts, products, services, surveys, AMAs and links to other areas of reddit require moderator pre-approval. 
>The following (not exhaustive) list of items require moderator pre-approval: meta-posts, posts to products, services or surveys, links to other areas of reddit, AMAs. Please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) for pre-approval.

9. ###Users may submit only one post per day. 
>Users must follow all reddit-wide spam guidelines, and in addition must not submit more than one post per day on /r/philosophy.

10. ###Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch.
>If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting /r/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth).  Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden. 

##Commenting Rules
1. ###Read/Listen/Watch the Posted Content Before You Reply
>Read the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively. If you have unrelated thoughts or don't wish to read the content, please post your own thread or simply refrain from commenting. Comments which are clearly not in direct response to the posted content may be removed.

2. ###Argue your Position
>Opinions are not valuable here, arguments are! Comments that solely express musings, opinions, beliefs, or assertions without argument may be removed.

3. ###Be Respectful
>Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Slurs, racism, and bigotry are absolutely not permitted.

Something different? Try **/r/InternetIsUgly**. If you exhibit a similar addictive lust for information as you do for internet, we highly recommend you go give **/r/dataisbeautiful** a sub too.  

If this subreddit for whatever reason fails to provide the interactivity you need, we also highly recommend a look at **/r/interactivewebsites** for a less diluted dosage of interactivity.

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 

##4. Flair

* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).

##5. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). 

* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.

* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time.

In addition to reddit's global rules, /r/creepy enforces the following:




**1\. NOT CREEPY DON'T POST IT!** Insufficiently creepy submissions will be removed at moderator's discretion. Generally speaking, if it can work as a post on a comedy or a cute subreddit, it doesn't belong here. Abandoned buildings without a creepy context will be directed elsewhere.   

If a post is *completely* off topic, please report the post and [**message the mods.**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy)

**2\. Do NOT complain ""That's not creepy!""** in the comments or in post titles. Defamation of the subreddit itself and those who disregard the sidebar rules will be banned permanently. As a counterbalance against rule #2, keep in mind that different people are creeped out by different things, and suspension of disbelief helps the atmosphere. Just downvote and move on, or upstage them by [**submitting something even creepier.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/submit ""You know you want to."") You'll notice the loudest complainers never actually submit anything good themselves. The health of any subreddit depends on users like you submitting quality content and the community voting wisely.

**3\. No pictures of costumes, makeup, or children's art.** From October 1-31 there will be a ""Halloween Megathread"" where the costume rule will be lifted in said thread. However comments will be closely monitored.

**4\. No memes, religious discussions, or politics.** Post content of that nature in their specific subreddits, this place isn't for comedy it's not a church or a place to discuss politicians.  
 

**5\. No imgur gallery links!**  Instead, use direct imgur image links or album links (http://i.imgur.com/EXAMPLE.png or http://i.imgur.com/a/EXAMPLE instead of http://imgur.com/gallery/EXAMPLE, for example) as they're easier for mobile and RES users to open. 

**6\. No Comment Spam.** Take the I took an arrow to the knee or hell in a cell comments elsewhere. If you persist with said comments you will receive a 3 day ban as a warning. 

* If you see any rule violations, please [**message the mods**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy) and we'll look into it as soon as possible. Please include a link of the 
comment or submission in question, as this makes it much easier for
the moderation team to handle the issue.

**8\. No Videos** Video content belongs in /r/videos that means no YouTube submissions or V.reddit posts. We do however accept Gfycat gifs and Imgur gifs if linked properly.

##Rules

1. All posts must be [wholesome memes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/wiki/allowedformats)

1. Be general, not specific.  Memes should be relatable, with universally uplifting themes. Avoid posts that promote an ideology, religion, or brand over others, & posts that show individuals' politeness without some universal theme. Memes about controversial themes, people, and/or institutions are not allowed either.     

1. Please avoid submitting NSFW content.

1. Please no trolling, harassment, rudeness, or behaviour unbecoming of the wholesome users we know you to be. Keep comments civil and be respectful of your fellow users. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5qd45d/swearing_and_wholesome_memes/)    
Be nice. This is a happy place.     
No proselytizing. Keep your religion, your politics, your diet, and any other crusade you might carry to yourself. We come here to get away from arguing and politics and the like, so please respect that by keeping your agendas to yourself.

1. Please do not post personal info, yours or others. All names should be blocked out, except public figures.  Also, private communication is private; please don't post it here.  

1. Please link to images directly. This makes browsing easier for those using RES or through a mobile device.

1. Please do not post low effort memes (upvote memes, metareddit, etc.) This includes ""Let's get this to the front page!"" type posts, ""You have been visited by"", ""people who sort by new"", ""stop scrolling"", ""check your data"" 4th wall interaction type meta posts, posts that mention reddit karma, upvotes, and ""I don't want upvotes but..."" type posts. Additionally, it includes low effort memes such as Skyrim ""Wholesome 100"", ""You're Breathtaking"", Thanos ""That does put a smile on my face"", [happiness noises], Fallout [Everybody liked that], and ""Because that's what heroes do"". [See here for more on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/caocrq/rule_7_clarification_and_update/)

1. Please avoid re-posting memes. (Browsing Top/New posts can help, also [Tineye](https://www.tineye.com/) & other image searches.)   Do not spam or post more than 3 memes in a 24 hour period.

1. Please make an effort with your title. Avoid generic titles, try to be descriptive or fun.

##[**In Depth Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/rules/)

######**All rules are subject to moderator discretion.**

#####`1.` **Posts on this subreddit must be exciting and interesting images of nature.**

>This is /r/NatureIsFuckingLit, a nature appreciation subreddit: content must contain nature.

>No posting of non-wild (captive) or domesticated animals. No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.

#####`2.` **Submission Titles**

> Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.

>Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say ""[Subject] is Lit"".

#####`3.`  **Reposts**

>No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.

>Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. 

#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  

>We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.


#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  

> No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.

**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**

We hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :)

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.

#Voting Guide

**YWBTA** = You Would Be the Asshole;

**NTA** = Not the A-hole (and the other person is); 

**YWNBTA** = You Would Not be the Asshole  (and the other person would);

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

---

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.

This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).

Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. 

Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Brigading will earn a permanent ban.**

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

Don't even *mention* violence.

If your post or comment references violence, don't share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn't allowed.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.

##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts

Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""

Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.

##8. No Shitposts

Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.

This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.

Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Updates and META posts are restricted

Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.

Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the [update criteria](https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw) for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
 
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.

##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts

We do not allow posts where the central conflict is about familial or platonic partings, relationships, and/or reproductive autonomy.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)

AITA for dating _ (or not)

AITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)

AITA for being attracted to _ (or not)

Any reproductive autonomy decision

Any posts related to cheating- including ""telling on"" someone for cheating (or not).

And similar.

##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub

If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.

No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups

##13. No Revenge Stories

There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.

##14. No Medical Conflicts

AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.

dadjokes,r/DadJokes - the best (and worst) Dad Jokes on reddit,"Welcome!

This is a friendly place for those cringe-worthy and (maybe) funny attempts at humour that we call dad jokes. Often (but not always) a verbal or visual pun, if it elicited a snort or face palm then our community is ready to groan along with you.

To be clear, dad status is not a requirement. We're all different and excellent. Some people are born with lame jokes in their heart and so here, everyone is a dad. Some dads are wholesome, some are not.

It's about how the joke is delivered.","Hello and welcome to r/dadjokes!

Only self-posts are allowed. However, you may still link to images within the self-post if the image is relevant.

**A couple of suggestions to follow:**

1. Leave the punchline out of the title!

2. Preferred to be a joke an actual father said, but not required.

3. Tag [NSFW] or [NSFL] if ever necessary. 

4. Remember to edit out any personal information that could lead to identifying people in real life. This includes, but is not limited to, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook/twitter/instagram screenshots.

oddlysatisfying,Oddly Satisfying,For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.,"###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does ""Oddly Satisfying"" mean?
We are forever searching for a ""true definition"". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* ""oddly satisfying"" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as ""2048"", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.

* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. 

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (""Say it, don't show it.""). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as ""My..."", ""Mine..."", ""Our..."", ""We..."", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing & ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments & Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is ""Oddly Satisfying"" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).

* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).

* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.

* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion:

 - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.
 - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.
 - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.
 - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).
 - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.
* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.
* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).
* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.

/r/travel is a community about exploring the world. Your pictures, questions, stories, or any good content is welcome. 

Clickbait, spam, memes, ads, brochures, classifieds, surveys or [self-promotion](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) will be removed. 


**No politics** and keep it civil.

###Submission Guidelines

1. [**Read the FAQ** and search before posting](/r/travel/wiki/index). Avoid repetitive questions. Search the subreddit to see if topics have been covered already. Check our **[destinations of the week](/r/travel/wiki/topic-of-the-week)** page for country and city tips.

2. [Include a **descriptive title**](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_use_descriptive_titles). One or two word titles rarely provide enough information. Include the country/region.

3. If submitting an image or video **include context** - [read this section of the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/faq#wiki_.22here_are_my_holiday_photos.21.22). No quotes, selfies, or other clichés: we're not your facebook.

4. Be **[as specific as possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_give_specifics)**: where you're starting, dates of travel, budget, interests, places you've been, things you like and dislike. Visa and passport questions: **state your country of citizenship**.

5. **Check [Google](https://www.google.com)** before posting.

6. **[Present the research](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_show_what_you.27ve_already_found)** you've already done so we don't feel like we're doing everything for you; we are not your travel agents.

7. **Stay around** to answer questions or respond to comments. This applies to all questions, image, and blog posts. Do not delete posts with replies.  

8. **[Low-effort posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/submission-guidelines#wiki_avoid_low_effort_posts)** (""Peru: tell me everything!"", ""Where should I go?"") will be removed without further notice. [**Example of an excellent post**](http://redd.it/1a7y8n)

9. **Do not delete posts after receiving substantive responses**. It's rude to the people that responded and makes it hard for other people with similar questions to find your post.

HistoryMemes,A sub for Historymemes,A place for history memes.,"[A History Network Member](http://www.reddit.com/r/historynetwork/#/button/c/red)

This subreddit was created because there was a niche that was not being filled in the historical Reddit community. There was no place to be a redditor in history. All of your historical jokes and memes go here. (This is a place for memes, not propaganda.)

Our Friends (those who promote us are in bold):

* **/r/historyanimemes**
* **/r/animemes**
* **/r/roughromanmemes**
* **/r/redditthroughhistory**
* **/r/shittyaskhistory**
* **/r/LOTRmemes**
* **/r/dankmemesfromsite19**
* **/r/artmemes**
* /r/prequelmemes
* /r/OSP

Remember, this is the memes part of the historical community of reddit, not the historical part of the memes community of reddit. Treat it as such.

Looking for our Discord Server? Scroll down below!

##**RULES:**


**RULE 1: Keep posts history related**

Please keep all submissions to the sub related to history and/or based on historical events. [See here for the extended rules.](https://reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)

All submissions must be as historically accurate as possible.

Ideological memes are not allowed.

**RULE 2: No reposts**

All reposts, similar and identical, of posts previously submitted to the subreddit are banned and eligible for removal.

Rule 2.1

Crossposts are allowed as long as it is not a repost of a previous submission to the subreddit. Crossposts should also be marked with the flair ""X-post"".
 
**RULE 3: No discrimination or abuse**  

Any excessive sexism, homophobia, racism or any other form of discrimination will be dealt with harshly and mods reserve the right to impose bans without warning. Basically try not to be jerks.

**RULE 4: Year limit**

All posts must include only subject matter of at least 20 years old from the post time.
Example: Memes about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers won't be able to be posted till September 2028.

Rule 4.1 - Meta use

Posts that either complain about Rule 4 or use Rule 4 as a loophole to circumvent the rule are not allowed on the subreddit. 

**RULE 5: Banned formats**

Certain memes and formats, such as ""Retake the Holy Land"" and ""Hitler Suicide"", are banned on the subreddit. A full list can be found in the extended rules [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/historymemes/wiki/extended_rules)

**RULE 6: Do not deny or defend genocides and atrocities.** 

These include, but are not limited to; Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, Japanese war crimes and the Tiananmen Square massacre. Doing so will result in an instant permaban. Hateful historical revisionists are not welcome.

Do not downplay or use whataboutism in discussion of atrocities and genocides

**RULE 7: No Brigading**

No calling for meme wars or inciting subreddit drama. This includes brigading, raiding, harassing other subreddits and their users, or likewise.

Political talks in comments are okay, but linking to external sites in which are about it are not. Directly linking posts to political subreddits is not allowed unless it is linked in a non-participating manner. [For more info see here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro)

**RULE 8: Post Memes**

All submissions to r/HistoryMemes must be memes. If it's not a meme, post it elsewhere but here. [See here for the extended rules.](https://reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)

Meta memes that pertain to the subreddit are allowed.

**RULE 9: Quality control**

Memes must adhere to some basic standards. Excessive black bars, improper cropping, and low resolution/unreadable memes are banned from the subreddit. [Please see the extended rules here for a full list and explanation on banned practices](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules).

**RULE 10: No karma-whoring**

Memes asking for upvotes, awards, and user actions are not allowed. [See here for the extended rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)  

**RULE 11: No low effort titles**

All submissions to the subreddit must include a proper title that does not exemplify qualities signifying ""low-effort"", ""Lazy"", or ""Karma-whoring"". [See here to see what is prohibited](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)   

Rule 11.1

If the title is removed from the meme and it ceases to be either a historical meme or a meme in general it is not allowed on the subreddit.

**RULE 12: No 1900's Onwards on Weekends**

Memes that are about historical events, trends, or topics from January 1st, 1900 (AD or CE) are banned on weekends (EST) to encourage creativity and topic diversity. 

Meta Memes complaining about Rule 12 are (still) prohibited everyday.

AnimalsBeingDerps,"Aww, they're so stupid","Pictures, gifs and videos of animals being derps","#####Welcome to /r/AnimalsBeingDerps!


[New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

###About Us

**RULES**

1) **Not derp** Don't forget, though most Derps are incredibly r/aww, a lot of Awws aren't Derps. Pictures/gifs/videos should be easily discernible as ""Derpy"", and removals are up to mod discretion. Animals just existing, or not doing anything, or otherwise engaging in normal animal behaviour will be removed. Do not post images with superimposed text adding context for the ‘derp’ to be understood. Your post should be able to stand on its own without help from the title or additional text

2) **No compilations or memes** No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.  No memes or comics

3) **No NSFW** No NSFW content allowed. Posting NSFW content is grounds for being banned without warning. This includes comments, posts and title. Linking to NSFW subreddits is never allowed. Warning others that a post or comment is NSFW is not an excuse for violating this rule. Do not add the NSFW as clickbait, misuse of the the NSFW tag is prohibited

4) **No reposts** Reposts will be removed at mod discretion. Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban

5) **No derp injury** Do not post animals that are injured, suffering or appear to be uncomfortable

6) **No staged submissions** No staged submissions, no provoking animals to do something derpy or setting up a scene for an animal to do something cute or quirky. No photoshopped, AI generated images, or manipulated videos. No TikTok trends or challenges. A human playing with their pet is considered staged and not derp

7) **No links to social media, post direct links only** No links to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter, Imgur Gallery. Use direct links only for images and videos

8) **No comments supporting killing, eating or harming animals, no breed hate** Threats or denigration towards any living being are not allowed and may result in a ban. Do not joke about eating animals or share your views on eating animals. No breed hate

9) **No hate speech, personal attacks or insults** Hate speech, personal attacks or insults will not be tolerated. Do not use condescending or patronizing language, or resort to name calling. Violators of this rule may be banned without warning

10) **No spam** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but please, no spam. This means no posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, artwork, subreddit etc. GoFundMe requests or petitions are not allowed. Users violating this rule will be banned

11) **No Sad Content** This includes mourning posts, or mentions of death in the title (ie. RIP), or animals being put to sleep. (try r/petloss)

12) **Repost/Karma/Spam Bot or Bot like activity** Bots or bot-like activity will be permanently banned. This includes karma, spam or repost bots

[Mod Approved content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AMod%2BApproved)

##RULES

###1. This is a happy place. Be respectful.

Comments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.

Bullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.

If the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.

###2. Audible and contagious laughing

All videos must contain contagious laughter.

Do not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.

Audience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.

Compilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.

No bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.

###3. Video length

Videos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.

If the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.

###4. No reposts

Reposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.

Remember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.

It's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.

###5. Post must have a proper title

Use a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.

Examples of bad titles: ""."", ""title"", ""😂😂"", ""funny title"", ""wait for it"", ""this made me laugh""

###6. No content promotion

This subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.

###7. No politics

Political videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free."

&nbsp;

The most important rule is **Just Post**. If you've never had a post or comment removed it means you haven't been posting enough.

Our unique rule is that **all posts need to be titled ""me irl""**. Posts that aren't are automatically removed. 

We do not allow posts that reference suicide. This community is not equipped to handle this topic. If you are feeling suicidal [we have some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.

**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.

**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!

**Don't make posts that request upvotes** or any other kind of reddit metric (gold, comments, etc.). That age of me irl is over.

confession,Admit your wrongdoings. ,"/r/Confession is a place to admit your wrongdoings, acknowledge your guilt, and alleviate your conscience.","#Submission Rules

##**Not A Confession** 

**All submissions *must* be a confession!**

* A confession is an admission of an illegal or immoral action you have intentionally committed that others are not aware of. It cannot be a thought, dream, opinion, kink, etc. Innocent mistakes or accidents are not intentionally committed. You cannot confess the misdeeds of other people. You MUST express regret for your actions in your post. 

* Your confession **must** be an act you committed.

* If your submission does not contain a confession it will be removed.

* An unpopular opinion is not a confession. 

    * Regardless of whatever unpopular opinion you hold, it doesn't classify here as a confession. You haven't done anything wrong, so to speak, so it isn't technically a confession. Better subreddits for this would be /r/offmychest, /r/TrueOffMyChest, /r/rant, or in some cases, /r/relationships.

* Your sexual exploration is not a confession; it's a part of finding out who you are. 

    * /r/confession is not a place for submissions that read like pornography. Despite our confessional theme, we don't find consensual sexual exploits sinful. /r/gonewildstories would be a better place to share.
&nbsp;

##**Be Specific** 

**All confessions must be titled specifically!**

* Your title must relay a brief idea of what wrongdoing you have committed. Submissions with vague titles will be removed.

    We receive a lot of meta-confessions that lump a lot of confessions into one, and a lot of submissions with titles that hardly relate to the confessions within. These kinds of posts don't take the subreddit in the direction we want it to go—it dilutes the content and leads to far more submissions that read like creative writing rather than the thoughts of real people.

    Ideally, your title is a TL;DR of your post.

##**Do Not Encourage Bad Behavior** 

*Helping one another also means that we do not encourage bad behavior.*

We will not accept posts that:

* 2a) encourage rape/rape culture; 

* 2b) sexualise minors;
 
* 2c) are racist; or

* 2d) otherwise promote abusive or hateful behavior.

##**No Relationship Related Posts** 

**/r/confession is not the place to seek relationship advice.**

* Even if your submission contains a confession, relationship-based confessions will be removed. /r/relationships, /r/offmychest, or /r/self would be better places to share. We reserve the right to remove any posts referencing relationships, not just those seeking relationship advice.

##**No Pedophilia Type Posts**

**At this time, this subreddit does not accept pedophile-type confessions, even if the user is seeking help and/or working on their situation.**

* In the past these types of confessions have been a fine line between acceptable and sexualizing minors. We recommend you seek out sources such as:

    * http://www.virped.org/ (18+ Only);

    * A counselor that can effectively aid you; or

    * Another subreddit like /r/self, or /r/offmychest. However, we do not know their stance or moderation policy on pedophile-type posts.

    Unfortunately, We are not well versed in the help that may be available. Hopefully this is a starting point for you.

##**Limited Context**

**We do not accept posts with limited context.**

* Confessing only the barest of snippets or most cryptic of details isn't the purpose of this sub. Understanding what you're confessing shouldn't be like pulling teeth, context is important.

&nbsp;

##**No Politics**

**Political-themed posts are not allowed.** 

* There are plenty of subs around Reddit to discuss your political views. 
 
&nbsp;

##**Meta Posts** 

**Meta posts are for moderator use only.**

&nbsp;

# Commenting Rules


##**Be Kind and Civil** 

**This is a place to help one another; keep your comments kind & civil. Any form of abuse is not permitted.**

* If you are unable to discuss without being disrespectful, walk away.


##**No False Post Accusations** 

**Accusations of fake posts are not allowed.**

* If you're posting on /r/confession, chances are you're not in the best frame of mind to be fielding attacks on your credibility by the vast and uncaring anonymous internet. We instituted this rule to better protect our submitters and provide a more constructive rather than detractive environment.

* You may report spammy posts, but commenting solely to try to discredit the experience an OP has claimed to have is at best nonconstructive and at worst genuinely hurtful. Please message the moderators so they may decide if it should be taken down instead. 

* This extends to any harassment of OP.

##**No Trolling** 

**No memes, trolling, or otherwise blatantly low-effort content.**

* There are many subreddits for us to fool around. This is a place for us to stay on topic. Comments and replies should be of substance and contribute to the conversation.

&nbsp;

##**Do Not Doxx** 

**No attempts to identify OP.**

* Not only is it against sitewide rules, but attempts to identify posters undermines the comfort and reassurance that lies in anonymity. 

##**Removal Appeal Process**

Follow the steps below to have your comment or post approved:

1. Read the rules to determine which was violated,

2. Remove the offending portion of your post or comment,

3. Message the moderators to have the post or comment approved (skip to this step if the removal was in error).

*We abide by a three strike system here. Three rule violations will result in at least a three day ban.*

---

##**Ban Appeal Process**

> Follow the steps below to have your ban reversed.

* Read the rules and review your post history to determine why you were banned
* Message the moderators with a case as to why your ban should be reversed. This should be based on the information in the first step. (If the ban was in error, skip to this step)

Welcome to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy !!

**Rules of Engagement**

> **Remember, we come from a varied and diverse background, and all of us have different perceptions of what cheap and healthy means. There is no one right way to eat for all people and all budgets, and there is always room for improvement. Please keep things cordial and respectful, and if you think you have a better set of recipes, lead by example and post them! This means you are not allowed to tell people their content is not healthy, period.**


Post your freezing, canning, recipes and ideas for people to eat both cheap and healthy. 

> **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SUBMISSION RULES:**

> **1** **All links or image posts must include a formatted recipe.**

> **2** **No direct links except to imgur.com and youtube.com** 

> **3** If you want to post a link to a website, you can use the **SELF POST** option and leave the formatted recipe along with an embedded link in the text box.

> **4** All posts, and comments must follow reddiquette and self promotion guidelines. We monitor things a bit loose here, but will step in without regard if the content does not fit our sub theme or violates site guidelines. No polls, surveys, research for school, no ads, limited self promotion, etc. Please be positive, constructive criticism is welcome but being mean is not. See our rules of engagement mantra for clarification. This also means that any arguments of dietary restrictions are not allowed, no matter which side you argue for. Nobody has time for that drama.

**Please be constructive with your comments! If you have a healthier option, please post that instead of discourse.**

* moderators will remove comments or users who just want to argue and do not add to the healthy discussions. It's just food but to some people, the recipes, images, discussions and interactions here can help them to get to a better place in their personal lives. We use reddiquete as a rule here and not just a good idea. 

**Please help us grow the community.**

* While we encourage new content we also want the bloggers and people who just post external links to interact with the community. Any questions concerning whether you are a blogger with a reddit account or a redditor with a blog can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

[Enter mildyinfuriating &nbsp; &nbsp;( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)](https://td.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/#button)

Is your day filled with midly infuriating problems? You came to the right place then.

**Rules**:

A: No reddit meta posts.

1) [No Memes or ""meme-like"" image macros.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1exsuk/meta_modpost_new_rule_see_inside_for_details/) No Memes or ""meme-like"" image macros. These include overdone references in the title (e.g. “banana for scale”, “potato quality”, and so on).

8) Content requirements:

* a) Please try to post original content. Reposts or crossposts of someone else's content will be removed if it has been posted on Reddit within the past 6 months. At the moderator's discretion, content posted without the author's original consent or without linking to an original source will also be removed.
* b) No GIFs that end slightly before something happens ([Example](http://i.imgur.com/Lq6m5QY.gifv))
* c) Unn^ecessarily overdone ^text, ar&rarr;rows, scribbles, or substantive edits over the original content are not allowed.
* d) No posting surveys - posts about surveys are allowed, however bear in mind they are often overdone.
* f) Blur out any personal information. (Full names, phone numbers, license plates etc.)
* f) R3: Respect Reddiquette and Follow Reddit Rules
* g) R4: No grandstanding, politics, or pushing agendas. No meta reddit posts.
 This includes posts that could be, within reason, regarded as politically, sexually, racially, or socially inappropriate or unnecessary. ([Example](https://i.imgur.com/Um3eIs7.jpg)). Posts that push an agenda of any sort is also prohibited, including inappropriate posts about this subreddit or other subs as described in ""prevent brigading"" rule. If you're unsure if your post or comment falls under this rule, message the mods to ask!
4) R5: Prevent brigading, including using ""np"" links for Reddit

6) Prevent brigading. Mentioning subreddits is fine; talking about them in a negative way is not - Use modmail for disputes, not posts. Also, when posting links to reddit in comments, please use ^[np.reddit.com](np.reddit.com) formatting in order to prevent brigading.

These rules are **subject to the moderator's discretion**, and can change at any time. A full, in-dpeth explanation can be found in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/about/rules).

###Want more posts with just OC? Try using the [FILTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/search?q=OC&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all).

Please include text recipes in your comments, if possible. 

**Submission Rules**

**Rule 1 - Posts Must Be Foodporn Related**

* As r/FoodPorn is a food photography subreddit, all posts and comments must relate, in some way, to food photography. Any comments or posts that are hateful, rude, or antagonizing will be removed and the user may be banned at the mod’s discretion. Do not engage with trolls. Any gatekeeping of content that you deem unworthy can result in a removal of content and result in a ban, per the mod team's discretion. 

**notes**
*We also will remove content that is not up to our standards as a food photography forum. Stage the food, make sure lighting is on point, make sure plating is on point. Make an effort. This is not a dumping ground for /r/food photos.*

**Rule 2 - Only Submit Single Images and Gifs**

* Gif's are only allowed as long as they comply with the rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/4nc3m0/rfoodporn_now_allows_gifs/).

* Videos, collections, interactive images/websites, and articles are not allowed.

**Rule 3 - Include Context in the Title**

* Include some context in the title (including the name of the food, not just the type of meal e.g. lunch). All non-OC must credit the content creator in the title. 
* If it is your image, please place an [OC] tag in the title. We also offer [OC] flair for users to flair their content. 
* If it is non-OC, use the “credit: content creator“ tag and include the name of the content creator.  

* Low effort titles will be removed. Please try and describe what's in your photo the best you can (e.g. ""Dim Sum Lunch"" or ""Antipasto with parma ham, olives, gruyere cheese, and breadsticks"").

**Rule 4 - One Non-Original Post Per Day**

* You may only post one non-original content post per day. A ""non-OC post"" is a photograph (or gif) that you did not create yourself.

**Rule 5 - Recipes should be in plain text**

* We do not require posts to include a recipe, however we do strongly encourage it. If you decide to include a recipe it must be posted in plain text in the comments section. You are free to link to off-site recipes, but there must always be a plain text version in a comment, if there is to be any recipe at all.

**Rule 6 - Civil Comments only**

* Please remember the human and keep your comments civil.

###Community guidelines

* Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
* News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.
* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
* No referral links in submissions.
* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like ""Buying 100 BTC"" or ""Selling my computer for bitcoins"" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.
* Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from *new* merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider [Reddit's self-serve advertising system](https://ads.reddit.com).
* Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.
* Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Parenting,Reddit Parenting - For those with kids of any age!,"/r/Parenting is the place to discuss the ins and out as well as ups and downs of child-rearing. From the early stages of pregnancy to when your teenagers are finally ready to leave the nest (even if they don't want to) we're here to help you through this crazy thing called parenting. 

You can get advice on potty training, talk about breastfeeding, discuss how to get your baby to sleep or ask if that one weird thing your kid does is normal.","######Make this subreddit a better place! Vote and participate in the [new section](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/new/?sort=new) and report rule violations.


/r/Parenting is a subreddit for anything related to the controlled chaos we call parenting. 

Do you have a question for parents?  Head over to /r/AskParents.  

Did your kid say something awesome?  Join us at /r/thingsmykidsaid.  

Are you a caregiver or nanny?  Check out /r/nanny.  

We also recommend /r/relationships, /r/legaladvice and /r/family. 

#####Community Rules
1. Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts
 * Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child's life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you're a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly ""Ask Parents Anything"" thread in this sub or visit r/AskParents.
1. Be Decent & Civil
 * Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.
1. No Medical & Legal Advice
 * Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on r/legaladvice for legal advice.
1. No surveys, studies, or interviews
 * Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to r/samplesize.
1. No linking, promotion, or advertising
 * We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it's the main focus of the submission.  This rule applies to both posts and comments.
1. We are a discussion-first sub
 * This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to.
1. No Sexual Content Involving Minors
 * Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child's doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.
1. General Posting and Moderation
 * Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We'd be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don't meet the standard of our community for review! Your human moderators thank you for your patience and understanding.
1. **Rule P** - No Photos of Children
 * Sometimes you want to post a picture of your little one, maybe to illustrate something that's happened to them, or to just share!  We currently do not allow pictures of your little ones to be posted here, due to privacy and safety concerns.  Please check out our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to instead!
1. **Rule S** - Things My Kid Said Threads
 * We have the **""Things My Kid Said""** weekly thread about things your kids have said.  Please consider saving your submission for this thread instead!

---
☑️
RULES

1.) **Do not post content just because a black person posted it.** This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people.

-    1. **No original content.** We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just  for     this subreddit.
  


2.) No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).
 
3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
 
4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.
 
5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).

6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.

7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.

8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add ""bruh"", ""fam"", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.

9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking ""what does x mean?"" will be removed. 


10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.
 
11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  

12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**
