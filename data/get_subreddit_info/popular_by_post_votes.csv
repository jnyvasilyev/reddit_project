**Subreddit Rules**
---

-----

###**I. Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**
1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.


###**II. Don't be a cunt**

1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.


###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**

1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. 


###**IV. Mod discretion**

1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible


###**V. -**

1. -


###**VI. No excessive spamming**

1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.


###**VII. Number 7**

1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.


###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**

1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t


###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**

1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. ""idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not"" then just mark it anyways.


###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**

1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.

 This includes posts that could be, within reason, regarded as politically, sexually, racially, or socially inappropriate or unnecessary. ([Example](https://i.imgur.com/Um3eIs7.jpg)). Posts that push an agenda of any sort is also prohibited, including inappropriate posts about this subreddit or other subs as described in ""prevent brigading"" rule. If you're unsure if your post or comment falls under this rule, message the mods to ask!
4) R5: Prevent brigading, including using ""np"" links for Reddit

6) Prevent brigading. Mentioning subreddits is fine; talking about them in a negative way is not - Use modmail for disputes, not posts. Also, when posting links to reddit in comments, please use ^[np.reddit.com](np.reddit.com) formatting in order to prevent brigading.

These rules are **subject to the moderator's discretion**, and can change at any time. A full, in-dpeth explanation can be found in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/about/rules).

*Repeated violation of rules may result in banning*

3) Added emphasis on rule 8g: NO POLITICS

7) /u/dnanf may post whatever he wants, even if it's shit. It is your duty as a good redditor to upvote his posts.

##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)

> 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.
2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. 
3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.
4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.
5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. 
6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  
7. **[Cite Sources.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_7._cite_sources)** - If your comic is a direct adaptation of an existing joke, tweet, post or meme, please cite the original source in the comments.

##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)

> * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.
* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.
* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  
* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.
* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.

##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)

> * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to ""fix"" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.
* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.
* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.


##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)

> Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their ""Original Content."" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.

  PrequelMemes,PrequelMemes - Memes of the Star Wars Prequels,Memes of the Star Wars Prequels.,"*Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*


## RULES:
**1. NO METAGAMING**

**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**

**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**

**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**

**5. NO POLITICS.**

**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**

**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**

**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**

**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**

**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**

**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**

**12. NO PROMOTION**

**13. NO MISINFORMATION**

**14. NO SPAM**

##DETAILS:

1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.

2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.

3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. ""Prequel"" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. ""Just a picture of Obi-Wan"") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.

4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.

5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.

6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.

7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.

8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.

9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.

10. Here are the requirements for reposts:

Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them

It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted

All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such

OP must provide the source of the original in the comments

11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.

12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions

13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.

14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams."

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts should be regarding U.S. politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly. 

     Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, leftists, etc!), but please keep posts civil. 

2. **Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.** 

 **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.

 If it's isn't funny (or at least trying to be), we'll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)

 If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. 

 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a ""flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn"" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.


3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** 

    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. 

4. **Images & short GIFs only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.

    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  

    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within ""allowed"" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** 

 Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. 

 Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  

6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, including use of ""tard"" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. 

  If you're intentionally trolling, including ""google games,"" you will be banned. 

7. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. 

 ___7b.___  **No ""Meta"" Posts.**

 Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.


8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 

9. **No pointing at offsite resources**

  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.

  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.

###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderation actions are done at each moderator's own discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message and we'll take a look at why you were banned for you. Contrition will play in your favor if you were banned for violating our rules. 

* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)

  whenthe,whenthe,The funny moving pictures with text subreddit (REIMAGINED) 😔✊,"**RULES**

**Rule 1. Be Funny**
Make sure your post has an actual joke in it, don't make lazy situations such as ""When your mom calls you to dinner"" or other r/memes type shit. This rule also applies to posts where the punchline is that the caption is long, as well as posts where the caption is unreasonably long. This is a general catch-all rule to make the subreddit have the same humor as it did when it was more niche, and wasn't as popular as how it is currently.

**Rule 2. Be Original**
Be original; if you see a hilarious joke here don't try to recreate the meme with a few changes, that's how you get repetitive memes like the 2000th skinwalker meme we've seen. We won't list every type of punchline and meme we see, it should be obvious if you're blatantly copying a joke.

**Rule 3. No Meta**
If the purpose of your post is to simply shit on communities, celebrities, and even ourselves with whatever with no clear punchline like ""They suck and do annoying thing 🤓"" don't submit the post. This also applies to praise without clear punchline, as it's just advertising. Generally, if your post is more for sharing your opinion and isn't a joke, just please shut up lol.

**Rule 4. Post Criteria**
Your post has to have an iFunny style gif caption, as written in the subreddit description. This means black, center aligned, usually bolded text on a white background overlaying above the gif. You can either make these on the iFunny app or using esmBot on Discord (join ours) Please don't use Memeatic or impact font macro memes.

**Rule 5. Don't Repost**
Anything posted in the past 3 months or anything in the top 30 posts of our subreddit can't be reposted. This is done to keep things fresh for new and old members and is simply a good practice. You may use or crosspost memes that follow our criteria from other subreddits or Discord servers, but before doing so make sure it hasn't been posted already by searching through the subreddit. If your posts are OC, this shouldn't pertain to you.

**Rule 6. Don't be a degenerate**
Don't act like an immature degenerate, this isn't the place to talk about sex or fetishes. Do not post gross content just for the sake of getting a reaction, e.g. fetish art, wounds, bodily fluids. Blatant defense of illegal sexual concepts such as zoophilia, pedophilia, and child porn is strictly prohibited.

**Rule 7. No Politics**

Do not try to push certain political agendas especially if there is no real joke to the meme in question. We would like to steer away from any political discourse on this subreddit."
  dndmemes,DnDMemes,DnDMemes is a community dedicated to memes about  DnD and TTRPGS. We are still currently protesting the unfair practices of the Reddit administration.,"**Rules**

**Rule 1. Be Excellent to One Another**: No trolling, harassment, personal attacks, [sea-lioning](http://wondermark.com/1k62/), hate speech, slurs, or name-calling. Overly off-topic, political, or hateful debates will be removed, and bans may be issued based on severity. This includes both posts and comments. We reserve the right to remove content or comments that contain discrimination or distasteful content. Be kind and stay on topic. 

**Rule 2. No Reposts**: Posts must not have been posted in /r/DnDMemes before. Reports with direct links to the original post will greatly expedite their removal process. Reposts from other subreddits are allowed, but once a meme is posted to /r/DnDMemes, it will forever after be considered a repost. 

**Rule 3. Post Style Guide:** Posts must be strongly relevant to D&D (or other TTRPGs) and must include an attempt at humor or entertainment. Posts must be legible, understandable for a general audience and have some effort put into them, including titles. Video posts may be up to 3 minutes long, and they must be humorous in nature. Only one meme is allowed per post; posts with multiple images inside of them, such as a collage, will be removed. Posts must not rely solely on the title to relate to D&D.

**Rule 4. No Advertising:** Meme culture is non-profit. No links to stores, fundraising/payment sites, or comments asking for money/followers. Social media handles or website watermarks on original content are acceptable, unless these are monetized, and self promotion of one’s own social media should be limited to once per week. Accounts whose sole purpose are to push products, whether legitimately or fraudulently, will be permanently banned and their content removed. 

**Rule 5. No Piracy:** Do not share or request pirated content. No linking, hinting at, or naming hosts of illicit non-SRD D&D content. You are allowed to copy-paste relevant rules or sections from sources, but large blocks of text may be removed.

**Rule 6. No Beating a Dead Horse:** Moderators may step in to issue a 3 month prohibition on certain meme topics and formats. The requirements for placing a topic on hiatus are 1. The topic has been prominent on the front page for at least 3 days or 2. The debate topic is toxic in nature. Certain historically overdone themes or formats may be retired permanently at moderator discretion/per user poll. Please see the [current list](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmemes/wiki/index/retiredmemes).

Rare threats are also welcome (as long as you flair your post)

#RULES

###1. Don't be a dick
It's not hard, just be nice to each other.

###2. No hateful insults
Don't post hateful insults

###3. No reposts
Don't repost. Please refer to our [common repost album.](https://imgur.com/a/8XDVQtt)

###4. Not a rare insult/threat
/r/rareinsults is not for unfunny/common insults, this includes insults that follow the random [adjective]+[noun] formula. It is only for rare insults. No other post types are allowed

Corporate insults also fall under this category. [Click here to learn more!](https://redd.it/ghj57g)

###5. No personal information
Personal information includes full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and usernames

###6. No politics
Political submissions will be removed and posters will be permanently banned.

If your post is removed for another reason and you repost, do not title your post ""reposting because it was removed.""

###8. No long videos (>10s) or long texts
Don't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.

Insults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.

This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)

Welcome to /r/BikiniBottomTwitter, a place to share all of your favorite memes, cosplays, and fan art from our favorite underwater residence, Bikini Bottom! 

Bikini Bottom has a unique way of examining the everyday and we're here to showcase that. Whether it's hilarious, wholesome, depressing, or surreal, Bikini Bottom offers relatable commentary that we all can enjoy. If you can't respect that then please take a bus to Rock Bottom.

Special thanks to u/BayonettaBasher!

________________________________________

###THE RULES

1. **All posts must be a Spongebob meme.** Do not post content just because it features a resident of Bikini Bottom. **Fan art and cosplays are allowed.**
If you want a sub catered to that sort of thing, check out r/Spongebob. As for here, *this is for memes and for memes only. We do not consider videos to be memes.*

5. **ABSOLUTELY NO REPOSTS.** Posts must have not been posts *in this subreddit* before.
[Use this nifty little tool to determine whether or not your post has already been here.](https://reverse.photos/)

2. **Don't be a dick.**
No racism against squirrels. No hate speech. No posts about how different Pearl is from her father.

3. **Do not put the punchline in the title of the post.**
 Having a funny picture of a Bikini Bottom resident and using the title as the punchline *does not make your post a meme.*

4. **Do not post *really* low-effort memes.**
Using excessively overdone and/or outdated templates, posting something that is excruciatingly unfunny, begging for upvotes, *cake days posts*, posting something that simply doesn't make any sense... you get the idea.

6. **No spamming.** More than 4 posts in 24 hours is considered spam.

6. **The mods reserve the right to take any action (which includes banning users and removing comments) that they feel improves the overall quality of this subreddit.**
Our most basic duty as mods is to keep this sub clean of any bullshit. With that in mind, we will do whatever we have to do in order to uphold that responsibility. How's that for a little transparency?

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, video, or photo essay of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.     

**PLEASE READ OUR SEVEN QUICK RULES:**

1: Photos and videos must be over 25 years old. 

2: Please put the year or decade in title, otherwise your post will be removed. 

3: Spam, racist, homophobic, sexist and offensive comments, as well as brigading, consistent reposting and shitposting, will result in a lifetime ban. Offensive comments include anything about pimping, about people's moms and scoring women. Nobody cares about your sexual impulses, least of all the OP.

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed. 

6: All posts must feature a person.  

7: We reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't showcase historical coolness. This includes photos, which are not obviously retro and portraits of famous young women doing nothing but posing.

  iamatotalpieceofshit,People who actively act like a piece of shit,"A place to post screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.","A place to post social media screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

##**Rules:**

1. **No personal information.** Take a screenshot and completely **redact all information that can be used to identify a person**. This includes, but is not limited to: **first and last names, usernames (including your own, including the symbol which identifies a commenter as you, including any other people featured in the image, including public accounts), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, and other information like addresses, phone numbers, profile pictures, and license plates.**  If you intentionally post personal information, you will be banned. This is to prevent brigading and harassment, so we take this rule very seriously.  **Do not post reddit screenshots.**
**Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, openly solicit personal information, or contact the people featured here. Don't even wax poetic about wanting to post identifying information. You will be banned. There are no exceptions to rule 1.**
2. **Do not encourage, glorify, or incite violence.**  
For example: ""Kill yourself"", ""It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles"", ""This guy needs to die"", ""I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver"", etc. Don't even joke about it, as ""I was kidding"" will not be taken as an excuse.

3. **Must be a total piece of shit**  
A total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, annoying but harmless things, memes & image macros, trophy hunters, people who put down their pets humanely, short & unoriginal comments, overly political/partisan posts, screenshots of someone's Reddit profile, petty arguments, fights/simple revenge, and common/unoriginal crimes do not belong here. Anti-vaxxer posts rarely belong here.  
If your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed. It is very rare for anything featured on reddit, comment or post, to be shitty enough to be featured here. Do not post reddit screenshots.  
**If you post a picture with the backstory in the title or comments, no story in the image, or just the face of a public figure, you will be banned.  This isn't punchablefaces.**

4. **Avoid reposting**.  If you see a repost, report it, preferably with a link to the previous post.  

5. **No news articles. Images, screenshots & gifs only.** Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred.  Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it.  **Screenshots of the headline only will be removed.**  This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.  

6. **No posts featuring gore, animal or child abuse.** Posts featuring gore/child/animal abuse are not allowed here.

7. **No screenshots of subreddits, reddit profiles, reddit posts, reddit comments, or reddit direct messages.** Not even if you hide usernames. If you submit anything related to something happening on reddit you will be banned. This is to prevent harassment. Don't bring your reddit drama here. 

8.  **No racism/hate speech/bigotry/idiotic race baiting**  No racism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry. If they're a piece of shit, you don't need to bring their whole demographic into it.

---

**Do not report users through modmail**, use the report button with a custom reason.  The only exception is for reporting people who are actually doxxing or other immediate threats.  Do not report people for being mean to you, arguing, or making comments which you disagree with.  If you abuse the report button or modmail, you will be banned.  **If you ask for someone who follows the rules to be banned, you may be banned.**

Posts with bad titles will be automatically removed, you can then resubmit with a better title.  No, you cannot edit your post title or image once it's been created, and neither can the mods.

####RULES

###**Rule 1: Images must be both blessed and cursed**

* If an image makes you happy, but then at the same time, frustrates or disgusts you, then it is likely blursed. Still not sure? [Here](https://imgur.com/a/IxkAijD) is a compilation of some of the best blursed images

###**Rule 2: Title Guidelines**

* Titles must start with ""blursed"" or ""blursed_"". Titles should not exceed 5 words long (this means no sentences).

###**Rule 3: No text or memes**

* Memes, and submissions where text is needed to make the image blursed are not permitted. 

 A meme is defined as an image that follows repetitive meme formats, or could be posted and allowed on subreddits such as r/memes or r/dankmemes. 

* A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t cross out all the text in the image and still have it be blursed, then there is too much text.

###**Rule 4: NSFW, Offensive or Political Content**

* NSFW content is not allowed, and will be removed. **Posting NSFW will incur a ban of at least 7 days.**

* Offensive content will be removed under this rule. This includes content such as: Nazi-related posts, racism, terrorism-related content, etc.

* Due to it's divisive nature, political content is banned. r/BlursedImages is for admiring the most blursed images on the internet, not for waging political arguments, and we want to keep it that way.

###**Rule 5: No reposts**

* No Reposting posts that are under 3 months old, anything with a flair, or has more than 5k upvotes.

* Chainposts are also not allowed **and will lead to a ban of minimum 7 days**. A chainpost is usually an image asking you to repost it. Here's an [example](https://i.imgur.com/fNYCfqp.png).


###**Rule 6: No Videos/GIFs**

* Videos/GIFs are not allowed. Please go to r/blursed_videos for that.

###**Rule 7: No low quality images**

* This includes: 

 1) Distracting watermarks 

 2) Bad cropping 

 3) Low resolution images

##[Discord!](https://discord.gg/aJqgAYK)

##[Subreddit Rules](https://i.imgur.com/zqhVQCP.gif)

- Rule 1: All posts must have a boss enemy style title. We thoroughly encourage creative boss names, reference other posts for good examples. Extremely low effort titles, including certain uses of apostrophes and accents, are subject to removal at the moderator's discretion. Additionally, we may remove posts that have extremely overused phrases in it. If your title does not meet this rule we can help suggest a new one.

- Rule 2: All posts must be in the style of a boss fight. This is a video game and RPG themed sub. If your post does not contain allusions to a boss enemy, an npc, or clear RPG elements focusing on these then it likely does not fit here. This place is for real life things that seem like video game bosses, not literal video game bosses.

- Rule 3: No personal attacks / blatant offensive posts or comments. This includes but is not limited to: racism, homophobia, transphobia.

- Rule 4: All posts must lead directly to an image file, gif, or large hosting website. YouTube videos are also OK. However, no personal blogs / spam.

- Rule 5: ""Bad reposts"" will be removed by moderators.  A ""bad repost"" is a repost that has already been on the front page (>100 points) in the past month, is lower quality than the original image, is a badly cropped version of the original image, is part of a cluster of multiple reposts in the same 24 hour period, breaks any other of our rules, or is on our Banned Images list (work in progress). Moderators can approve ""good reposts"" at their discretion based on the following criteria: the repost is more creative than the original, the repost is receiving more attention than the original, the repost has a better title than the original, the repost has a better image quality or better crop than the original, or more than 1 month has passed since the original was posted. **Important note: Numerous Tuba Man variants will definitely be on our banned images list, and posts of the Tuba Man in any form will result in a 7 day ban.**

- Rule 6: Posts deemed low quality or unfit for the subreddit will be removed. This includes posts that are memes, text posts (including images that rely on border text), photoshopped images (with exceptions for exceedingly high quality edits), and crossposts (subject to moderator discretion).

##### [](#h5)
>See a submission or comment that breaks these rules? Hit that Report button and we'll look into it ASAP. Please include a link if you are reporting a repost.

##### [](#h5)
>We will always try to notify you when a submission is removed. If you violate the rules purposefully multiple times, especially rules 3 and 4. Blatant severe violations to rule 3 may result in an immediate ban, but - as above - it can be appealed.

##### [](#h5)
>Any user posting personal information (doxxing) will be immediately banned and reported to the admins as per reddit rules.

  ThatsInsane,ThatsInsane,"For things that are a little bit more wild, crazy, scary, terrifying and incredible than the average. And for stuff that is generally insane!","## Rules

1. **Only ""ThatsInsane"" content**. This subreddit is for things that are a little bit more wild, crazy, scary, creepy, terrifying and incredible than the average. And for stuff that is generally insane! Fake content does not qualify as ""Insane content"". Please have in mind that insane content does not need to be very interesting. And insane people on Twitter and Facebook is ok. Think before submitting, would I find this post ""ThatsInsane"" if it would be someone else who posted it. Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of ""ThatsInsane"" from viewers.

2. **No Racism and Hate speech**. Racism and hate speech will be removed and the poster will be banned. No questions asked.

3. **No pornography or overly gore material**. Examples of what can count as ""overly gore material"" include stabbing, shooting, rape, serious injuries, nasty things, and other content that contains scenes with a lot of blood.

4. **Moderator Discretion**. Posts are at the discretion of the moderators. If we do not believe it fits the sub, or think it is spam, we will remove it.

5. **Repost Guidelines**. This is only for reposts that have been posted to /r/ThatsInsane recently, is in top of all time or have been posted so often on reddit that the majority of users have seen this content.

6. **Image w/ text posts must be sourced in comments**. Image w/ text posts must have a linked and credible source that backs up the information.

7. **Use descriptive titles**. Non-descripted titles will be removed. Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. ""insane"" or ""this is crazy"" is not a proper description.


8. **No visible death or torture posts**. No videos containing scenes of people being executed, murdered, slaughtered, commiting suicide, or being tortured on tape. This rule only applies to when an individual’s death is visible and you see their corpse. If they are in a vehicle, and you are not able to see their corpse (only the actual accident), it may be allowed. Keep in mind that this rule is only for humans and not for animals.

## Misc.
  * [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/ThatsInsane) if you have questions or concerns. We are active and will respond as soon as possible.

  BrandNewSentence,Brand New Sentence,"For sentences never before written, found in the wild.","###[DARK MODE](http://dm.reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence)
###[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence)
***

#[OUR DISCORD](https://discord.gg/GfxVA6q)

***

#Rules:

**1\. Post screenshots of discovered brand new sentences**

Post must be a screenshot of the sentence, as well as some additional context. 

Sentences that qualify as ""brand new"", in the terms accepted by this subreddit, have the following atributes:

- never been said before, or said few enough times to qualify as ""almost new"" 

- not an idiom (or a translated idiom)

- humorous or confusingly worded

**2\. Check if the sentence has been said before before posting**

It is encouraged to perform a Google search of the sentence before posting it. Use the `""` character (double quotation marks) to search for the exact string of words in order to produce the best results.

If the results produced are many and have various apparition dates, it is most likely that the sentence is brand new. 

If there are many results, but all on the same day, the sentence is likely new (and therefore qualifies for this sub) but has become popular (which is OK).

**3\. Reposts are not allowed**

Search for the sentence on this sub, in order to avoid your post being taken down due to a repost.

**4\. Avoid satire and shitposting**

Here is an example of a [sentence that is meant as a joke](https://reddit.app.link/CG0Fo6efyV), in a satirical way. Due to highly popular demand, this kind of posts are no longer accepted on this sub.

This is not a meme sub.

**5\. Do not post sentences created by bots**

**6\. The brand new sentence should be in the title**

It is encouraged to use the new sentence as the title. If you don't want to do this, use a creative title.

Titles that are considered boring and will be removed:

- *I think this belongs here*

- *One of my friends said this*

- *Found on...*

- *On a topic about...*

- *What* / *Lol* / *I don't even know where to begin*

- *This whole thread* / *Two in one*

**7\. Link the source in the comments**

This rule applies to sentences found on the Internet.

Exceptions to this rule are:

- text messages (sms, WhatsApp, Discord)

- Facebook posts on private groups

**8\. Be civil**

**9\. Do not incite political or ideological debates**

You must not, under any circumstances, comment on a post in order to incite debate. This is usually the case with sentences that mildly refer to controversial topics such as politics, LGBT+, vaccinations etc.

Please keep this sub relevant to its purpose and do not flood the comments section with off topic debates. Any debate is off topic as long as it is beside the point of the subreddit: enjoying the novelty of a sentence."

###**RULE #1: DON'T BE A DICK**

###Violators will be dealt with on a case by case basis, but repercussions will include comment removal and in some cases, bans.

###This subreddit is meant to be a place free of excessive cynicism, negativity and bitterness. Healthy skepticism is fine under certain circumstances, but toxic attitudes are not welcome here.

  starterpacks,Starterpacks,Home of starterpacks!,"* [Full rules and policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/wiki/index)

# Rules

**1. Must be a Starter Pack**

 Your post must be a starter pack, not a list or any other meme.  Remember:  attributes, not examples.

**2. Be creative**

Jokes that are done to death, recent reposts, slight edits of existing posts, reposts of top submissions are highy frowned upon, and may result in a temporary ban. This rule doesn't explicitly apply to posts involving recent events, only if it's done to death.

Text-only posts, posts simply with examples of an item, and posts about you will most likely be removed.

**3. No blatant bigotry**

Slurs and racism that would get you fired are not allowed here.

**4. Be nice to each other**

You don't have to agree with each others opinions, just try to be civil in your discussions.

**5. No politics**

Incidental political items in a starter pack are okay, but this sub is not an arena for political agenda posts or political arguments.

**6. Starterpacks must contain 2 or more unique images**

The userbase has decided that single item starterpacks are lazy not starterpacks and must contain more than one item. Duplication of one item to make up the pack can be seen as a subversion of this rule and will be removed at moderator discretion.

Emoji and screenshots of text only do not count.

**7. Post title must include name of starterpack**

The title of your post must include the name of the specific starterpack you are posting. Low effort, single word, irrelevant post titles will be removed at moderator discretion.

**8. No reposts**

We want OC (Original Content).

**9. Imgur/Reddit image posts only**

In order to prevent spam, posts to /r/starterpacks must be submitted as images hosted on Imgur or Reddit only.

####[/r/CasualConversation has great resources for just about any problems you may be having](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/support)

This is a subreddit for memes that hit too close to home or are too real for subs like /r/meirl

We are not /r/depression however, the sticky is a good resource for if you need real help. If you have depression, talk to a therapist, it really does help. You are not alone, and recovery is possible and worth it.

If you find jokes about suicide, depression or self harm upsetting, this sub might not be the right place for you. This is a place for people who use self deprecating humor as a coping mechanism, not for those making fun of mental illness.

With that out of the way, the rules are as follows:

* **Asking for upvotes/downvotes will get you banned**. And any other vote related bullshit for that matter.

* Posts *MUST* be in some way ""too real"" or hit to close to home. If it doesn't make you laugh and feel sad at the same time, don't post it here. Posts that do not fit the sub may be removed.

* Being edgy doesn't make a post good. Post content that you find a bit too relatable, not something making fun of people with depression.

* Posts should be titled 2meirl4meirl or some variation, but other titles are fine for ~~shitposts~~ self posts.

* Be supportive. Most people here are going through something, and sometimes all it takes to improve a shitty day is just a little kindness from an Internet stranger.

* Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, any other form of discrimination and general dickishness *will not be tolerated.*

* Mark NSFW content as such. And please don't post NSFL content, we are not /r/watchpeopledie

* **Reposts are allowed**, but discouraged

* Don't link to an image if it won't be there permanently. Basically, just don't link to files hosted on 4chan.

* Again, please don't be an asshole.

* If any of you fucbois post mr skeltal you will not have good bones and calcium, and instead your post will be removed. Mr skeltal will not be thanked. Dat boi as well.

  coolguides,Cool Guides,"Picture based reference guides for anything and everything. If it seems like something someone might print, physically post, and reference then it is a good link for this sub. 

Remember: Infographics are learning tools, guides are reference tools. Sometimes it's grey.","**Post Requirements**
To help keep things nice, searchable, and maintainable, all posts must be prefixed with ""A cool guide"". For example, ""A cool guide about identifying poison ivy"", ""A cool guide showing how to clean your house"", or ""A cool guide for painting your living room"".

**Defining a Guide**

Guides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables.  It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.

**Defining An Infographic**

An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. 

**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**
These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.

***Subreddit Rules***

**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**

**2. Infographics will be removed.**

**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**

**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**

**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** 

If you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!

Many of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.

***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***"

OkBR is a satirical meme subreddit where we pretend to be 8 year olds who JUST gained internet access and made clueless memes in the early 2010s!








~~ READ THE RULES BEFORE POSTING! ~~  Don't repost random things you see that don't fit the subreddit's style ~~ make OC content! ~~



https://discord.gg/ragecomics ~~","# 0. [READ THE BANNED MEME LIST](https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/wiki/index)

# 1. Be Creative
*Do not piggyback off of already existing jokes/ memes.*

* If your post is a meme on [this list](https://old.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/wiki/index) and is uninventive, it can be removed. You may choose not to check the list, but doing so is not valid reason for a removal to be undone.

* Do not post format memes such as those that make up the bulk of /r/dankmemes.

* [Do not post any variant of memes like this](https://i.imgur.com/GW5WpCE.png). Essentially framing a meme within the UI of another website/application. They are extremely low effort and generally un-comedic. **Posting these will result in a 15 day ban.**

* Do not rely on certain ways of speaking to be funny, for example, ""hood talk,"" or lots of misspellings. These can make a funny joke funnier but they can also kill it.

* Your joke should **not rely on the title to be funny**. Please no blank images with funny ironic title.

* **Do not crosspost** or link to other sites such as Instagram. You may link to YouTube.

* Meta-posts are allowed, but must follow the rules while remaining **creative and interesting**.

# 2. Do Not Post Anything Better Suited for Another Sub 
**Here are some common confusions. Your meme might fit better in:**

* /r/ComedyCemetery - [(example)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/436/042/8b6.jpg)

* /r/ComedyNecrophilia - [(example)](https://i.redd.it/tdxd2ltmmli31.jpg)

* /r/dankmemes - [(example)](https://i.redd.it/cuhmado2ef421.jpg)

* /r/deepfriedmemes - [(example)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/223/167/040.jpg)

* /r/dogelore - [(example)](https://i.redd.it/t905yyixcfg21.jpg)

* /r/iamveryrandom - People being random

* /r/me_irl - [(example)](https://i.imgur.com/Mg68x6E.jpg)

* r/redditmoment - reddit bad

* [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/wiki/related) for more alternative / related subreddits.

# 3. Do Not Be Edgy

*Shock humor isn't funny and doesn't fit in this sub. You're not welcome here, edgelords.*

* Do not try to be offensive for the sake of it. There's a big **difference between a joke and just being mean**. 

* **Do not use the n-word as a punchline**. It's not funny. It's just edgy. 

* Do not make edgy jokes (sexism and racism) in the comments **EVEN** if you're ""ironic/in character**. You will be banned.

# 4. Do Not Ask for Upvotes

*Karma is a worthless metric designed to keep you scrolling through the ads on this website. Stop farming it you normies.*

* Do not make posts asking for upvotes, comments, gold, likes, double-taps or any other metric (even as a joke).  Your meme will be removed and **you will be banned for 15 days.**

# 5. Do Not Be Political/Push A Serious Opinion.

*OkayBuddyRetard is a meme sub, it is not your soap box.*

*[A more detailed outline as to why we remove political posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/comments/bv5fr5/a_word_on_politics_and_controversial_topics/)*

* Do not post anything pushing a political agenda or a opinion/serious statement even if you're ""joking"", whether you're a communist, a Nazi, or anything in between. Your post will be removed and you may receive a ban.

* Memes featuring political characters are only allowed if the character doesn't say or refer anything political. **The meme should be apolitical and neutral.**

# 6. Do Not Repost

*You're a cringe normie if you haven't seen every meme that's ever been on this sub. Please be original.*

* Do not post anything that has already been posted. **Reposts may result in a temporary ban**.

* Do not post anything that you've obviously just lifted from some other meme subs front page. We're all subbed to them too, we don't need to see them twice. 

* Taking a popular post and **changing it slightly still counts as a repost**. 

# 7. DO Tag All NSFW Posts

* Do **not** post literal porn. 

* **DO** tag posts that contain sexual language or imagery. 

# 8. Do Not Post Shocking or Illegal Content

*We shouldn't even have to say this.*

* Do not post gore, even if it's part of a ""funny"" edit.

* No sexualisation of minors or animals.

# 9. Do Not Make Memes About Serious And Recent/Ongoing Events

*OkayBuddyRetard is not about making jokes about serious and recent events. The person behind making the meme should act stupid and not care about real life world events.*

* Memes about a celebrity dying or a important event are not allowed. However memes about a recent but *harmless and comical* event that fits the sub (ex : omg new fortnite update) is allowed.

* Memes about serious recent events *can* be allowed if the poster acts innocent, apolitical and doesn't even understand the situation but those are rarely approved. In reverse, if the poster is trying to push a message about the situation even though he is acting in character **he will be banned.**

* Unretarding in the comments is also not allowed and if the user falls though the wordfilter cracks, he will be banned. **Stay in character here.**

# 10. Don't Act Elitist/Superior Against Another Group

*Elitism is a really bad thing for this community's image. If you act like a elitist, you're not a real retard.*

* You should not make memes mocking another subreddit or a group is **strictly** not allowed **EVEN** if the group is harmful.

* Memes that break this rule usually break rule 8 or rule 5 too. The poster will be **severely punished** and **potentially permabanned**

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

#####Welcome to Dunder Mifflin! 
Home to the Scranton Branch. 

This subreddit is for fans of the US version of the TV show, **The Office**. The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!


---

#####Discord Server

r/DunderMifflin now has a Discord Server. [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/dundermifflin) and discuss the show!

---
#####Rules

####1) Be Civil

Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. 

####2) No spam/Low-effort posts

Keep posts directly related to TV show ""The Office"". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk). Memes/images from social media will also likely be removed as they're 99% reposts.

####3) No piracy

Don't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.

####4) No politics

No posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. This includes posts mentioning/comparing something or someone from the show to a political figure, or anything you saw at a protest/strike/rally.

####5) No cake-day posts/asking for karma

Cake day posts are forbidden unless they are high-effort OC. 

####6) Image hosting

Images, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.

####7) Self-Promotion

The promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.

####8) No Merchandise
Posts that are about items of merchandise (""look at this cool shirt"", ""I found this board game"", ""I made Cards Against The Office"") are prohibited without prior mod approval.

####9) No New Spoilers
Actors from The Office may feature in new media and franchises. Though it may be tempting to discuss their new roles, feeling like this is a safe community to do so: it isn't. This subreddit is for The Office only. If you make a post or comment that spoils new content (within reason, like for a major franchise) in other ""cinematic universes"", the post will be removed, and you may receive a ban.

[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)

#####Guidelines:

####Reposts

Please do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.

Recent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.

####Stay relevant

Make sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image. If you have to give it a The Office title to make it relevant, it's not worth posting.

####Is your post low effort?

The following types of posts are low effort and will be removed:

* Pictures of your TV screen (especially ""are you still watching"" netflix screens)
* Photos of small wall-mounted TV screens
* AI-generated scripts, scenes, quotes, etc.
* Actors in other TV shows
* IRL sightings of names related to the show.
* George Foreman grills
* Photos of Randall Park (Asian Jim) making a joke about how it's actually Jim
* Screenshots of the show with nothing else added to them
* Any post with an especially shitty title

[More examples here of low effort posts](https://redd.it/95w3xk)

####Unexpectedoffice

Screenshots of Reddit/social media comments referencing the show should be posted to /r/unexpectedoffice instead.

#### Bots
Bots and novelty accounts, as determined by the mods in their sole discretion, are subject to arbitrary bans.

  WinStupidPrizes, Play Stupid Games Win Stupid Prizes,Sub dedicated to gifs and videos of people playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes.,"#####**Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes**



This is a sub dedicated to animated gifs and videos of people playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes. All posts must involve someone knowingly doing something stupid and winning a prize for their stupidity. 

**Rule 1: Win a Stupid Prize for Playing a Stupid Game**
All videos should feature a human doing something that an outside observer would say “hey, that’s a bad idea” and then suffering the consequences. Videos must include the stupid game and the stupid prize. People intentionally playing a stupid game and winning a stupid prize does not count, nor do prank videos, skits, or dumb stuff by small children.

**Rule 2: No Death, Gore, or Nudity**
Posts in which the participant dies (during or after the video ends) or grievous injuries are not permitted. Posts with something drastic should be labeled NSFW and flaired it as “Injury” or it may be deleted. Posts with full-frontal nudity or showing genitals will be removed. Posts that show nudity of minors (under 18) will be reported to Reddit Admin for action.

**Rule 3: Format**
All posts should be animated gifs and videos. No still images, screenshots of any kind, news links, compilation videos, edited videos, or memes.

**Rule 4: Titles Must Be Descriptive and Civil**
Please try to have a title that describes what happens in the video. This helps moderators track reposts. Titles lacking a description will likely be removed, but can be posted again with a descriptive title. Titles must also follow the rules of civility.

**Rule 5: No Reposting**
No reposts of anything within 90 days, or of anything on the Top 100 of all time.

**Rule 6: No Politics/Riots**
Posts and comments that are primarily political in nature will be removed. This includes posts about protests and political riots. There are plenty of subs dedicated to political discussion, please direct these comments there. Political posts and comments risk a ban.

**Rule 7: Be Civil**
All posts and comments must be civil, including replies to incivility. Personal attacks, racism, and bigotry of any kind are not allowed. Advocating violence is against site wide rules and will be removed. Severe uncivil behavior will be met with bans. Please report uncivil comments--replying with more incivility will also earn a ban.

**Rule 8: Mod Discretion**
The moderators reserve the right to remove any post or comment at our discretion even if it does not break the above rules.

# **About Us**

/r/trashy is a *celebration* of trash: people, things, media, etc. that boldly and shamelessly violates social conventions and cultural norms. Satisfy our voyeuristic drives by sharing trashy images, videos, stories, and fashion. 

# Rule 1: **Behave yourself.** 
* Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to Trash^TM are not allowed.
* Bullying is not allowed. 
* Toxic behavior of any kind is banned. 
* To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. 
* No witch hunts.
* Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

# Rule 2: **Submissions must be appropriate for this subreddit.**
* Posts must be a **CELEBRATION** of trashiness, posts about horrible people doing horrible things without a shred of humorous trashiness to them will be removed and you may be banned. 
* No images of those whose ""trashiness"" is clearly the result of a serious mental illness.
* No pictures of people in healthcare settings (e.g. doctor's office, hospital, clinic waiting room) that they didn't take and post publicly themselves (aka no doctor's office creepshots).
* No porn unless it is excessively trashy.
* No child abuse or animal abuse. 
* No child porn.
* No fake trash. 
* No pictures of literal trash, bathrooms, pee, poop, discarded tampons etc
* No posts of horrible, evil, really awful things like gore or death or torture etc.
* No reposts.
* No license plates.
* Remove all family names / usernames from submissions. Any information that can be used to find the subjects posted here is banned.
* All NSFW posts must be marked NSFW.
* No memes / image macros. This includes social media status updates consisting **solely** of memes / image macros.
* Posts must be Trashy^TM of their own accord, context is helpful but not sufficient to make it Trashy^TM.
* Please make an effort with your title.
* All social media posts that do not include a photo must include the comments.
* **No mass-produced novelty items such as bumper stickers, window decals or commonly posted t-shirt designs.** 
* **No violent crimes**
* No medical, political, or historical misinformation.
* **This is not TikTok.**  TikToks and ""Do it for the 'Gram"" type posts will be removed.

***
 [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/2sp32m/rtrashy_has_two_new_rules/) for information regarding  our two new rules.

# **Sidenotes**
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not a post is Trashy^TM. 
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not behavior is excessively toxic. 
* Comment threads with rampant rule breaking will be locked.
* Sexualizing minors will result in an automatic ban.

A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)
> ### 1.  Use proper formatting: (1) All titles must start with TIFU. (2) All posts must have at least 750 characters in the body. (3) All posts must have a ""TL;DR summary"" at the end.

######[](#space)
> ### 2.  Posts must be about you.  Today **I** fucked up.  Not your grandma, not some dude you saw in the newspaper.  

######[](#space)
> ### 3.  **Must be your fault**. Being a victim of something is not TIFU. Getting robbed, scammed, attacked, cheated on, etc, is not TIFU

######[](#space)
> ### 4.  No overly vulgar posts.  Eg:  No pissing/&#8203;shitting your pants.  No incest/&#8203;rape&#8203;/&#8203;minors/&#8203;bestiality.  No death of animals.  No glorification of major crimes.

######[](#space)
> ### 5.  Not a fuckup.  No humblebrags or stories that have zero consequences and don't go anywhere.  Eg ""tifu by sexy sex"".  Moderator discretion.    

######[](#space)
> ### 6.  Be civil.  No racism/&#8203;bigotry/&#8203;homophobia/&#8203;transphobia.  No personal attacks on other users, no name-calling.  No low-effort ""this didn't happen"" type comments.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/wiki/rule6)

######[](#space)
> ### 7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this."" These examples are by no means comprehensive, just don't self promote.

## Notes
#### **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story, you can start it with ""TIFUpdate"".

Antivaxx rhetoric or participation on antivaxx subreddits is cause for a ban from this subreddit.

  wholesomeanimemes,Wholesome Animemes and Anime,The community for your wholesome animemes and wholesome anime moments~,"**[Rule 1] Be Nice and Civil**

* 1.1) Users are expected to be nice and maintain a decorum of civility. 
* 1.2) Overly vulgar or creepy comments and content are not allowed. This community is not suited for such unpleasant behavior and content. 
* 1.3) Politics, religion, and other controversial topics are not allowed. There are other communities for such topics; r/wholesomeanimemes is not one of them.

**[Rule 2] Wholesome Anime-related Content**

* 2.1) This community is intended for wholesome anime-related content. 
* 2.2) For this community, “wholesome” is defined as:
	* 2.2a) Positive and intended to promote the well-being of mind and spirit; 
	* 2.2b) Absent of ill-intended, malicious, or depressive elements; and,
	* 2.2c) Contains a story/context to differentiate a post from a simple cute post (i.e., this community is not r/awwnime). 
* 2.3) A wholesome submission must be wholesome in its entirety or works its way towards such (i.e., silver lining). The mere inclusion of a wholesome scene may not be enough and can warrant a post’s removal. 
* 2.4) Wholesome scenes from unwholesome sources are subject to removal. 
* 2.5) “Wholesome” submissions with questionable or controversial undertones are subject to removal. 
* 2.6) Posts that use questionable or controversial elements, themes, or materials for a “wholesome” post are subject to removal. 
* 2.7) “Wholesome” can be subjective, however, moderators have complete discretion when removing posts deemed not wholesome. If you believe your post was removed in error, send us an appeal via ModMail. 

**[Rule 3] Animemes**

* 3.1) This community is intended for wholesome animemes (anime memes). 
* 3.2) Animemes determined to be too low-effort or insubstantial in their quality are subject to removal. This includes reaction posts, description posts, and posts with simple and uncreative edits. 
	* 3.2a) Creativity is encouraged. Hence, the repeated use of the same formats is subject to removal (e.g., copy-and-paste of the same format with minimal edits). 
* 3.3) Sources are encouraged but not required for animemes. 

**[Rule 4] Anime and Sources**

* 4.1) This community also permits unedited, non-animeme works that originate from anime, manga, and miscellaneous anime-styled works (e.g., self-made anime comics, fanworks/parodies/doujins). Please use the proper flair for these posts – “Wholesome Anime,” “Wholesome Manga,” or “Wholesome Anime-styled Work.”
	* 4.1a) Note: “Doujins” (or doujinshis) refers to self-published manga that can be either original or parody works. They do not necessarily mean R-rated works. 
* 4.2) All submissions that are made under this rule must be clean and unedited – stick to the original release. For example, no unnecessary watermarks, no self-inserts, and no edited compilations.
* 4.3) All posts that are made under this rule must include a proper, direct source of the original material upon submission. Sources must be provided either in the title or in the comments. If you do not know the source, then do not post. 
	* 4.3a) This is not a source-finding community. Hence, any source-requesting posts will be removed, even if someone else provides a source in the comments.  
* 4.4) Submissions categorized under this rule must use the minimum materials deemed necessary. For example, use a 30-second clip rather than a 10-minute clip. Or post 1-2 pages rather than 12 pages. Otherwise, they are subject to removal.  
* 4.5) Submissions of unedited, non-animeme works are limited to one per week per user.
	* 4.5a) This limit resets every Sunday at 00:00 UTC.
	* 4.5b) Unused submissions do not accumulate for future use.

**[Rule 5] Submission Standards**

* Posts may be removed for one or more of the following reasons: 
* 5.1) Posts must not be text-only or text-heavy.
* 5.2) Posts must not be in low resolution (e.g., post too small, “grainy” image).
* 5.3) Posts must not contain any visual obstruction (e.g., online advertisement, notifications, large watermark, substantial filler space).
* 5.4) Posts must not rely on the title to work.
* 5.5) Posts must not have an inappropriate or effortless title.
* 5.6) Posts must not redirect users to view the post.
* 5.7) Posts must not use the wrong flair.

**[Rule 6] No NSFW and R-rated Content**

* 6.1) Hentai, nudity, and other pornographic elements are not allowed. r/wholesomeanimemes is not r/wholesomehentai or r/wholesomehentaimemes (or any other NSFW/R-rated content-sharing community). Regardless of whether or not they depict explicit material, posts that are suited for the latter communities will be removed, such as content from R-rated websites (e.g., nHentai) or memes referencing R-rated material.
* 6.2) Sexually suggestive posts (i.e., horny posting) are not allowed.  
* 6.3) Mildly suggestive materials in posts are okay as long as their depiction is appropriate. Such posts must be tagged as “NSFW.”

**[Rule 7] Spoilers Must Be Properly Tagged and Marked**

* 7.1) All posts and comments that contain spoilers must be properly tagged, including the use of Reddit spoiler features. 
* 7.2) All posts with potential spoilers must include the source in either the post’s title or the designated spoiler flair. 
* 7.3) All comments with potential spoilers must include a proper forewarning and be properly marked.
	* 7.3a) For comments, use `>!spoilers!<`.


**[Rule 8] 24-hr Restriction on Airing/Releasing Works**

* 8.1) Recently released works, such as a new anime episode or manga chapter, are subject to a 24-hour restriction. Meaning, nothing recently released can be submitted for 24 hours. 
	* 8.1a) If a post violates this 24-hour restriction, please let us know either in the comments or via ModMail.


**[Rule 9] No Reposting**

* 9.1) Reposting previously submitted content is not allowed. 
* 9.2) Posts with overlaps from existing submissions will be treated as a repost unless they substantially distinguish themselves from existing submissions. Minor, inconsequential differences (e.g., better resolution, a few more frames) are not enough to treat a post as a separate entity from an existing submission.

**[Rule 10] No Karma Farming**

* 10.1) Karma farming is not allowed.

**[Rule 11] Content Restrictions**

* 11.1) Overused meme formats and other common contents are subject to restriction to prevent oversaturation. 
* 11.2) Currently, the following two meme formats are banned:
	* Memes that follow the “Guys only want one thing and…” formats;
	* Skyrim Skill Tree formats.

**[Rule 12] No Advertising or Self-Promoting**

* 12.1) Advertising or self-promoting is not allowed. For any questions, send us a ModMail.

**[Rule 13] No Bots or Novelty Accounts**

* 13.1) With the exception of useful or helpful bots, accounts suspected of being bots (or otherwise suspicious) are not allowed and will be banned. 

**[Rule 14] Moderator Discretion**

* 14.1) Moderators have complete discretion when conducting their duties and enforcing the rules of the community.

#Rules:

**Note**: We don't like too many rules in this sub, see the FAQ for more info.

###1. All posts must have a coherent title and a date that is in the past.
 - All posts submitted must have clear, readable text. A coherent description and date must be in the title. Dates must not be recent or in the future.
 - As if it needs to be said, but any posts with a date in the future will be removed. If you think you've found a clever way around this and try to message the mods about it you'll be met with ಠ_ಠ.

###2. All posts must be submitted to RES compatible sites.
 - All posts must be submitted to RES compatible sites, such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [Gyfcat](https://gfycat.com/) or reddit's own image host i.redd.it.
 - Reddit's own gif/video host, v.redd.it, is not allowed due to bugs and poor user experience overall.

###3. No reposts.  
 - The image/title combination must not have been posted in the last 2 months.
 - There is no limit on the posting of the same image with a new title.
 - No reposting any image+title combos currently featured in the [repost moratorium](https://imgur.com/a/T6ZiCry).

###4. No history memes.
 - The most [""quality""](https://i.imgur.com/Dvkh6wZ.gif) posts on /r/fakehistoryporn are those where the title and image both play an important role in the punchline. This means that adding captions (twitter-style, /r/adviceanimals style, or otherwise), photoshopping in people or objects, comics, or doing similar things to put the entire punchline or history reference in the image are not allowed. 
 - Photographs of text, subtitles on screencaps, image captions that match the post title word-for-word, and such are still allowed. 
 - You are free to post history memes with Fakehistoryporn-style titles over on /r/fakehistorymemes. For more information on how we define history memes, read our [post guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakehistoryporn/wiki/post_guidelines).

###Rule 5: The five-year rule.
 - No posts whose titles concern events within the last five calendar years (2018-2022).
 - Post titles clearly referencing events happening within the last five years but with a complaint date (e.g., ""Joe Biden becomes America's 46th President, 2004"") will still be removed. See the ""think you've found a clever way around this"" clause in Rule 1.
 - Posts about events within the last five years can be posted on /r/fakehistorymemes.
 - The date will roll over at the start of the new year. (as of January 1st, 2023, posts from all of 2018 will be allowed).

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.

While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.

Rules:

1. All posts must be a story that must contain some form of malicious compliance. Malicious is interpreted broadly, but posts where people do not comply with rules will be removed. Update posts must link to the previous post on this subreddit and are subject to moderator approval.

2. No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.

3. Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.

4. Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin & Hobbes.

5. Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.

6. It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).

7. Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.

8. No Acronyms As Names. Don't make up acronyms for your post. Don't use acronyms from another subreddit. Generally known acronyms are fine. Use industry terms if you like, but explain what they mean.

**We may take any action, including banning, for the first infraction of any rule!**

Warhammer 40k is a franchise created by Games Workshop, detailing the far future and the grim darkness it holds.

#About

""I guess Devil Hunter's the best for making money,"" proclaims chronically broke Denji, a Devil Hunter-for-hire. With his trusty chainsaw and chainsaw...dog, Denji vies to make it to his next meal; however, nothing is ever as it seems, and things never go as planned.

Madness begins with the story of a dark hero who will rock the world. A new era of devils, hunters, and chainsaws begins!

* Don't insult/ harass other users. Treat them with the same respect you expect to receive.

---

##2. Spoilers and latest chapters

* This rule is null and void for Part 1 but you can still mark them as spoiler if you want. There is nothing wrong in being respectful.
* For latest Viz/Mangaplus release, mark the post as spoiler if the submission is made within first 12-hours. Some readers are still at school/college/work during release time and 12hr buffer is perfect for same.

#RULES

**1. No Animal Abuse**  
Any photo or video featuring abuse of any kind towards any animal will be immediately removed and the OP will be immediately permanently banned and reported to Reddit administrators.

**2. Be Nice**
Be nice to the people. Be nice to the cats.

**3. Black cats only**  
No tuxedos, please. All posts must include a black cat, but as long as it has a black cat, it's permitted. A lil bit of white chest fluff is okay.

**4. Banned topics**

* No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. ""This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww"", ""it's my cake day"", ""my first post here"", ""any love for ..."").
* No fundraising.

**5. No reposts/spam**

Reposts from the last 3 days will be removed. This includes popular reposts identified by u/repostsleuthbot. If you feel that your post has been unfairly removed, we will be happy to discuss via modmail.

Crossposts from other subs ARE allowed, provided they are of black cats.

**6. No detailed pet death or injury in title**

Posts detailing on the death of your cat are not allowed. These are more suited for r/petloss and should be posted there. Photos of past pets are always welcome to honor their memory but explicit details of their passing are not welcome and will be removed. **No photos of cat corpses.** Discussion of details in the comments is permitted. 

**7. Soliciting medical advice is not permitted**

This subreddit is not the place to ask questions about your cat's injury or sickness.  The best advice an anonymous internet stranger can give is to consult a vet.  Moderators reserve the rights to remove or otherwise moderate comments suggesting treatments.

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

#Rule 4: No medical advice questions

No medical advice questions

#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions

Disallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc.

#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions

Suicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find here or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help).

#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging

No trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question.

Asking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that.

#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter

Nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics

Questions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.

We are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large. We reserve the right to make judgement calls on when a particular thread becomes disruptive to the sub, and we are unable to maintain a civil space for the discussion."
  unpopularopinion,For your Opinions that are Unpopular ,Share your burning hot takes and unpopular opinions!,"###[DARK MODE](http://dm.reddit.com//r/unpopularopinion)
####[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com//r/unpopularopinion)
***

##**How This Place Works**
* **Upvote:** Opinions that you Disagree with.    
* **Downvote:** Opinions that you Agree with.

##**Banned topics** 
* **Porn, Fat/Skinny/Body Weight, Pedophilia or Related topics, Posts about Sexual Assault, Nazi and related content, [Banned Topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/wiki/index/)**
    

##**Rules** 
* **If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.**  

Rule 1: **Your post must be an unpopular opinion.**

* Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.

* Your opinion must be unpopular. Unpopularity is a bit like an onion. It has layers. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular.

Rule 2: **Do not post low effort/satirical/troll posts.**

* We get it, you all think this sub is garbage and is just for popular opinions, and you want to be funny and post ""going to be downvoted to oblivion here, but I think racism is bad."" We enjoy the memes, but please keep them off the sub.

* If your post is just one sentence it will be removed. Please try and elaborate on your opinion and justify your position.

* Any opinion that is not well thought out, incoherent, internally contradictory or otherwise nonsensical is subject to removal.

Rule 3: **Do not post opinions that are heavily posted/have been on the front page recently.**

* Recent reposts are not allowed.

* Opinions that are constantly posted here are not allowed.

* Posts relating to highly popular topics aren't allowed outside of the relevant megathreads. You can find a list of the topics and their respective megathreads in a post on the top of the sub.

* POSTS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT ALLOWED. No, this isn't censoring criticism, they're just overposted. If you have a meta opinion, put it in the megathread.

* We ask that if a post fails to post do not just spam repost it; message mod mail.

Rule 4: **Be Civil.**

* This applies for both your behaviour on the sub, and the opinions which you post.

* Obey the sitewide rules and [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).

* No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or general bigotry.

* Some opinions are so inappropriate/offensive that they'll be removed as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.

Rule 5: **No Political Posts.**

* Our users have voted for no political posts in this sub, and this rule will not be changed until the majority votes otherwise. 

* It's very unlikely your political post is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to use the Politics Megathread pinned to the front page. Our civility rules apply at all times."

# Rules

#### See the **[Complete Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/wiki/rules)** for full explanations.

A very brief summary of the rules is below:

**1. Spoiler Policy**

Everything from the current season, until two weeks after it ends, is considered a spoiler. All posts must be marked/tagged spoiler during that time period and no spoilers in the titles. After the two weeks ends that season is no longer under the spoiler policy.

**Comics are always a spoiler and must be marked/tagged in comments and posts.** 

How to mark spoilers in comments do a > and a ! with no spaces then add your spoiler and end it with a ! and a < no spaces.
 >!spoiler tag!< 


**2. No Illegal Content/Piracy**

Anything that violates Reddit's content policy is strictly forbidden. This includes pirated material. Do not provide, request or encourage piracy.

Failure to follow this rule will result in a ban.


**3. Be Civil** - 

While the show itself often contains content and themes that are explicit, divisive, or otherwise objectionable, Discussion, debate, criticism, and disagreement are encouraged, but you must remain civil when doing so.

Harassment of any kind will not be accepted.

[Full Explanation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/wiki/rules#wiki_3._be_civil)


**4. No misogyny, homophobia, misandry, transphobia, racism, sexism, body shaming, ableism, etc.**

We won't tolerate hatred of any kind against anyone. This overlaps with the civility policy of rule number three. Use of ANY slurs is strictly prohibited.

NO Discriminatory speech, hate speech, or stereotypes

NO Body shaming, gossip, or speculation

[Full Explanation Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/wiki/rules#wiki_4._racism.2C_misogyny.2C_homophobia.2C_transphobia.2C_ableism.2C_or_any_other_hatred_will_not_be_tolerated)


**5. Content Policy** - Refer to our **[Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/wiki/rules#wiki_5._general_content_policy)** for full details.  


**6. Self Promotion**

While we do love to see fan-created content, we also don't want the subreddit to become an endless deluge of users promoting their YouTube channels, Etsy stores, etc.


**7. Politics Unrelated**

While The Boys covers many political topics and themes, this is not an inherently political subreddit.

For further clarification and some examples of what is considered relevant under this policy and what is not, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/vg5qax/rules_expectations_update_politics_clarification/)



**8. Repost or Spam**

Before posting content to the subreddit, please use the search feature and/or sort posts by ""New"" to ensure no one else has already submitted the same content. Content deemed to be sufficiently similar to previous posts may be removed at the moderators' discretion.

For a thread to not be considered a duplicate, it must offer significant additions to the topic at hand.
[Full description can be found here](Full description can be found here)


**9. Low-effort**

Most other forms of low-effort content will be removed. This includes self-posts with little to no text and generic joke posts.

[Full Description Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/wiki/rules/#wiki_9._low-effort_content_or_off-topic_posts)

**10.  Rape/SA denial or Minimization**

The Boys covers many very sensitive topics. One that has been repeatedly approached on the show is the topic of sexual assault.

Comments or posts denying or minimizing instances of sexual assault on the show, ""playing the devil's advocate"" about them, or attempting in any way to conflate these instances with consensual sex acts are strictly prohibited and will result in a ban.

Becca explicitly states that Homelander raped her in Season 2, Episode 4 at timestamp 57:21

A place for the shittiest, most mocking ""pro-tips"" you can think of.  Whether you want to let us know how glue can help out your hair or the quickest way to clog a public toilet, we're the place to post.

If your post does not appear in the new tab after several minutes, it may have been caught by our spam filter.  If this happens, send a message to the mods and we'll get it fixed up for you!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**WHAT IS A LIFE PRO TIP?**
A Life Pro Tip (or LPT) is a tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Rules:**

**1.** LPTs must be **shitty**.  The post must contain a life pro tip that is shitty. This isn't a dumping ground for shitty statements. Any tips that are actual good advice will be removed at the discretion of the mod team. What constitutes shitty is hard to explain, but much like porn, we know it when we see it.

**2.** No KYS posts. We will remove all posts with the tip ""Kill Yourself"" or any variation thereof.

**3.** No reposts. Reposts are lame. If you repost something within our top 25 of all time, you may be banned.

**4.** No circlejerking. Circlejerking is lame too. Simply copying a popular post from here, or LPT and putting a minor twist so it's ""shitty"" is also unoriginal, and we will probably remove those too.

**5.** NSFW discretion. Being gross for the sake of being gross will get your post removed at the mod's discretion. Most of these include bodily functions and fluids, or rape, etc. Pretty much anything posted simply for shock value.

**6.** Remain civil. If you act like a racist, pammer, or are being a general douchenozzle, the mods reserve the right to ban you without warning.
_____________________________________

**Note: For God's sake this subreddit is meant to be taken in a joking, satirical manner.  Please don't actually follow any of this advice, and don't report posts as inciting violence.  You should know this already, but some of you forget which sub you are in when you report.**

####[**Click here to view our full rules on the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/wiki/rules)

---
###Posting requirements

* You need to be at least 3 days old to post a submission or comment.

* You need at least 20 karma before you can post a submission. You can still comment on the sub to get that 20 karma!

###If you’re a content creator

* And found your work posted here without your permission, please [contact us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl), so we can help you remove it. 
* Reddit is a public forum; the moderation team can’t keep an eye on every piece of artwork posted to ensure they have gotten proper permission from the artists to be rehosted and modified. We rely on user reports and feedback from artists to enforce this.

###If you want to do a promotion in the subreddit

* Please [contact us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl), so we can discuss the best way to do it per the Reddit sitewide and subreddit rules. 
* Please note that the Reddit sitewide [guidelines on self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) still apply.

___

# Rules
### 1. Furry_irl is a subreddit for furry memes
* All submissions must be memes about furries or furry culture in a humorous or relatable way. Posts need to stand on their own; if the fact they are being posted to a furry subreddit is what makes them ‘furry’, then it’s not content suitable for this subreddit.

### 2. All posts must be titled “furry_irl”

* Submissions must have the title “furry_irl” (case-insensitive, you can use mixed capitalisation, lowercase or all lowercase, it doesn’t matter). The underscore _ can be replaced with any symbol, or even an emoji! (e.g. furry🐾irl)

### 3. Furry_irl is a SFW community
* Explicit adult content and/or imagery is not allowed. This community is for all furries, regardless of age, and we strive to make this subreddit a welcoming place for all members to submit and view content without concerns. Suggestive content needs to be tagged NSFW.

* If you want to submit or see NSFW furry memes, check out r/yiff_irl!

### 4. Direct image/video/GIF links only. Posted videos must be no longer than 2 minutes

* Because this is primarily an image browsing content subreddit, links to websites (even elsewhere on Reddit) will be removed. Please only post links to images, GIFs and videos. Use timestamps to skip ahead in a video to only share the relevant part.

### 5. Don't spam; submit quality, not quantity
* Please make sure that you allow at least 10 minutes to pass between each submission, and submit no more than 3 within a 24-hour period. This is so that other Redditors have the opportunity to submit content and have it visible to r/furry_irl users.

### 6. No threats or advocating violence
* Do not threaten, advocate for, or celebrate, violence, harm (physical or otherwise), or the death of others. This rule applies to everyone.

### 7. No personal attacks, doxxing, etc
* Name-calling, ad-hominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other users are not allowed. Public accusations (i.e. “call-outs” and “drama”) are not okay. Users are not allowed to post personal or identifying information of others for any reason.

### 8. Hate speech and discriminatory language are not tolerated
* Posts and comments using words or phrases that may be harmful are subject to removal, including but not limited to racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic or transphobic slurs. Non-malicious posts will still be removed; while some people are fine with being referred to by potentially harmful terms, we strive to make r/furry_irl a safe and welcoming place for everyone. Please do not use terms that make others uncomfortable.

### 9. No politics
* Do not post submissions or make comments that deal with overtly political topics or push for a particular political agenda. furry_irl is a meme subreddit; political content is inappropriate, and out of the scope of the topics we cover here.

  ABoringDystopia,A Boring Dystopia ,"A subreddit for chronicling how Advanced Capitalist Society is not only dystopic, but also incredibly boring.","#SUBREDDIT RULES

1.
A Boring Dystopia
This subreddit is centered around a specific theme: archiving horrible/dystopian events and facilitating discussion about it. It is not a r/WhitePeopleTwitter style ""free for all"" where everything goes.

Posts that do not fit the adjective and noun in the name of this sub will be removed. In cases of brazen violation of this rule a ban may be issued.

2.
Site-Wide Rules
Users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. Accounts suspected of ban evasion may be banned.

3.
Conversation Etiquette
The goal of this subreddit is to facilitate an environment where people can comfortably and constructively converse and discuss. Deliberate attempts to disrupt this environment will result in a ban and comment removal.

Examples:

-name calling; be it plain insults or online buzzwords, for example ""bootlicker""

-arguing in bad faith, such as whataboutism, derailing the discussion or any other attempts to shut down a discussion

4.
Advocating Violence
Advocating violence is against Reddit's sitewide rules. Violations will result in a temporary ban, with a permaban for repeat or serious offences. This rule includes thinly-veiled threats, or slogans such as ""Eat the Rich"".

5.
No Low-Quality Posts
Social media screenshots/links (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, etc), memes, webcomics, or other low-effort content will be removed and bans may be issued.

This rule also applies to overdone topics, including but not limited to: Medical bills, preventative measures for mass shootings, police violence, the cost of luxury purchases, charity for the destitute, generic US politics discourse, etc.

6.
Provide sources in comments
If you are posting an article screenshot, or making a debated claim, provide the original source link in the comments. Bans may be issued for deliberately spreading misinformation in either posts or comments. Satire must be flaired ""Satire"".

Rule is common-sense of course: you do not need to provide a source for a personal anecdote, or a generalization.

7.
This is not a Reddit drama sub
This sub is dedicated to archiving the boring dystopia we live in on a societal level. It is not dedicated to archive events going on on reddit or other social media platforms.

8.
Soapboxing
This subreddit is dedicated to archiving the horrid and boring events and institutions of our society.

Posts that are only a vehicle to express the posters opinion on a subject, do not fit the subreddit and will be removed accordingly.

9.
Repost - Common post or posted in the past 14 days.
Reposts are not allowed. If a post has been submitted or featured on the front page of this subreddit in the past 14 days, it will be removed and result in a possible ban. Common reposts may also be removed.

10.
Brigading and other organized harassment.
Calls for brigading or harassment of others on reddit, other sites or irl is not allowed and will be punished accordingly.

Posts involving neither public figures nor news sources must be censored accordingly to prevent identification."
