AllTheLeft,for ALL of the Left,Leftism > Liberalism,"#About

All the Left is an attempt at helping strengthen the left by bringing many viewpoints, factions, organisations, parties and tendencies together to coordinate, discuss and cooperate. This sub-reddit is meant to be a space where we can share articles, images, tweets, etc. to vent, coordinate, learn, and chat without being bogged down by sectarianism, liberalism, conservativism or any other bullshit that muddies the waters.

#Discord

Classical_Liberals,"Classical Liberals: Free Markets, Rule of Law, Individual Liberty","Classical liberalism is a political ideology and a branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties and political freedom with representative democracy under the rule of law, and emphasizes economic freedoms found in economic liberalism which is also called free market capitalism.","####[Classical Liberal Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/q8uCHPN)

#**Introduction**
Classical liberalism is a political ideology and a branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties and political freedom with representative democracy under the rule of law, and emphasizes economic freedoms found in economic liberalism which is also called free market capitalism.

Classical liberalism was first coined in the early 19th century, but was built on ideas of the previous century. It was a response to urbanization, and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States. 

Classical Liberalism generally doesn't include any socialist components (contrary to Social Liberalism) and so favors an individual's ability to distinguish themselves through hard work rather than substantial wealth redistribution. Classical Liberalism applies reasonable limits on liberty (contrary to Libertarianism) where pure individualism would be excessive for a properly functioning society.

NeoProgs,neoprogs: political discussion of a Neo-Progressive movement,,"This is a forum to discuss the continuation of a Neo-Progressive movement.

The movement will be inclusive, with room for disparate political opinions, but will also require a firm foundation consisting of clearly-defined core political positions upon which we can all agree.

We need to formulate our ideals in an articulate and actionable manner – avoiding any pie-in-the sky vagaries.

We seek leaders like Feingold, Kucinich, and Sanders – leaders who balance idealism with pragmatism.

So, how do we continue?

>**What is Social Democracy?**

> From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy):


> **Social democracy is** a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods.

> **Alternatively, social democracy is** defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.

> **The Social Democracy subreddit is home to social democrats of both types - and all inbetween.**

***

###### [](#h6-red)

>**Who Are We?**

>In a time of political gridlock, populism vs. non-populism, ineffectual government systems, and radicals calling for revolution, Social Democrats look to the worlds most prosperous nations as a model to pursue.

>There are several different forms of Social Democracy, but we have consensus on several key issues. We believe in reducing poverty; defeating wealth inequality; providing universal services such as healthcare, education, child care, & unions; supporting small businesses; taxing the wealthiest; and making sure everyone has an equal opportunity in life, regardless of their birth lottery.

>The nations of Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and New Zealand, which have all had Social Democratic Parties lead the nation within the past twenty years, are among the most flourishing nations in any international index, — whether it be happiness, quality of living, healthcare, & education.

>The halcyon days of Einar Gerhardsen, who saved Norway following World War II; Clement Atlee, who created the NHS; Tage Erlander, who led Sweden for a democratically elected 23 years; or Willy Brandt, who guided West Germany through the most strenuous period in human history, — we look to all these political icons as an answer to our future.

>To anyone new, feel welcome to engage in discussion, regardless of your political orientation! We welcome all, — from Communist to Conservative. We want you to know that we are not radicals, we are not extremists, we do not demand revolution or state take over, we simply want for everyone to experience economic freedom, personal liberty, & justice.

Socialism,"Socialism, a community for socialists","An international community for socialists, to discuss current events in our world from our anti-capitalist perspective(s). Certain knowledge of socialism is expected from participants. This is not a space for non-socialists. Please be mindful of our rules before participating, as they are actively enforced.

New to socialism? Please visit r/Socialism_101 prior to participating here.","#Welcome to /r/Socialism


**Socialism as a political system** is defined by democratic and social control of the means of production by the workers for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit, based fundamentally on the abolition of private property relations.

**Socialism is also a sociopolitical movement** dedicated to the critique and dismantling of exploitative structures, including economic, gendered, ethnic oppression.

Socialism, as a movement, confronts these different systems of oppression as mutually conditioning, intersectional, and/or dialectically related within the current hegemonic order. It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided.

We look forward to your participation in our sub, but please be mindful of our posting guidelines.
